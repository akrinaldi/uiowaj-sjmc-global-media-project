While these studies have primarily focused on adults’ eudaimonic media entertainment experiences, the current study explores whether games can lead to eudaimonic experiences amongst adolescents, for instance, via characteristics like emotionally deep stories and moral choices. Games are very popular among adolescents, while eudaimonic experiences may possibly fulfill key needs of identity development and peer relatedness as well as prove to be beneficial for adolescents’ well-being and overall development. To explore adolescents’ eudaimonic game experiences, we performed a qualitative study existing of six focus groups (N = 33) and 20 individual in-depth interviews (total N = 53). Results indicate that adolescents do experience eudaimonic game moments. Specifically, they experienced socially bonding, reflective (about oneself and society), emotionally moving, and elevating moments. These were considered particularly meaningful when they were somehow connected to real life. Finally, adolescents mostly mentioned narrative aspects (i.e., the game’s story, characters, moral choices), other real players, and audiovisual aspects like graphics and soundtrack as important elicitors of eudaimonic game experiences. Limitations and future research suggestions are further discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; Digital games; eudaimonic media entertainment; positive media psychology; qualitative research",,,,,,,,,"Banks, J., Human-technology relationality and self-network organization: Players and avatars in World of Warcraft (2013) (Doctoral dissertation), , https://mountainscholar.org/handle/10217/80931, Retrieved from; Bonus, J., Peebles, A., Mares, M.-L., Sarmiento, I., Look on the bright side (of media effects): Pokémon Go as a catalyst for positive life experiences (2018) Media Psychology, 21 (2), pp. 263-287; Bopp, J., Mekler, E., Opwis, K., Negative emotion, positive experience?: Emotionally moving moments in digital games (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2996-3006. , May, San Jose, USA:, &; Bopp, J., Opwis, K., Mekler, E., “An odd kind of pleasure”: Differentiating emotional challenge in digital games (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (preprint), , April, Montreal, Canada; Bowman, N., Oliver, M., Rogers, R., Sherrick, B., Woolley, J., Chung, M.-Y., In control or in their shoes?

In particular, new dynamics of parent–child relationship may emerge due to different accessibility to, experiences of, as well as values about ICTs between adolescents and their parents. Becoming proficient with a variety of ICTs since an early age, adolescent children in many contemporary families serve as technological experts on whom their parents rely to access and survive the digital world. This “role reversal” between parents and children indicates the detraditionalization of parental authority and parent–child interactions, which could strengthen family cohesion in some households, while triggering tensions and conflicts in others. Drawing on technology domestication theory and theory of emotion work, this article proposes an in-depth investigation into the multi-dimensional technological role-reversal activities of Chinese “study mothers” and their children, with special focus on subjective attitudes and invisible emotional labours of both mothers and children. An innovative “content-context diary” cum participant observation was employed to obtain a comprehensive and profound understanding of parent–child interactions in the process of household ICT domestication. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","content-context diary; emotion work; ethnographic observation; ICT domestication; Parent-child role reversal",,,,,,,,,"Aarsand, P.A., Aronsson, K., Gaming and territorial negotiations (2009) Childhood, 16 (4), pp. 497-517; Berker, T., Hartmann, M., Punie, Y., Ward, K.J., Introduction (2006) Domestication of media and technology, pp. 2-17. , Berker K.J.W.T., Hartmann M., Punie Y., (eds), Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press, &,.

Very little is known about it in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a self-administered survey among a randomly selected group of high school students in Tema, Ghana. Students’ self-esteem was assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Analysis including logistic regression explored prevalence and determinants of sexting, as well as its effect on sexual behavior. Five hundred and seventy-six (53% females) students participated. About 24.7% had shared sext materials using mobile phones. The predictors of sexting were being male (adjusted OR = 6.01, 95% CI 3.49–10.35), being in a “serious” (5.91, 2.77–12.64) or “casual” (2.82, 1.67–4.75) relationship and owning a mobile phone (1.82, 1.10–3.02). Students aged >16years (1.48, 0.94-2-34) and students with low self-esteem (1.24, 0.74–2.05) were more likely to be involved in sexting. Sexters were more likely to be sexually active (3.79, 2.33–6.14). Self-gratification and social pressures were the reasons for sexting. Fear that materials could go viral, religiosity and possible reprimand were the reasons students did not engage in sexting. Sexting among adolescents in this population is high and similar to levels in developed countries.

Additionally, this critical analysis explored misgendering within this genre and themes of social rejection and acceptance.

However, the impact of children’s subjective versus objective knowledge on their perceived online safety and attitudes towards e-safety education remain unclear. Questionnaires were used to assess children’s (N = 329, aged 8–11 years) perceived online safety, subjective and objective knowledge of online safety/dangers, and attitudes to e-safety education. While participants generally reported feeling safe online and perceived that they had a good awareness of online dangers and how to avoid them (subjective knowledge), they tended to be poor at articulating for themselves exactly what those dangers were and how they personally could elude them (objective knowledge). This was especially true of boys and younger children. Moreover, only subjective knowledge of online safety/dangers significantly predicted perceived online safety. Together, these findings suggest that some children may think that they know how to stay safe online but lack–or at least be unable to articulate–objective knowledge that could actually keep them safe. Consequently, there is a need to assess children’s objective knowledge of online safety/dangers and to provide appropriate education for children who currently lack it. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children; e-safety; internet; online dangers; Online safety",,,,,,,,,"Aarts, E., Verhage, M., Veenvliet, J.V., Dolan, C.V., van der Sluis, S., A solution to dependency: Using multilevel analysis to accommodate nested data (2014) Nature Neuroscience, 17, pp. 491-496; Annansingh, F., Veli, T., An investigation into risks awareness and e-safety needs of children on the internet: A study of Devon, UK (2016) Interactive Technology and Smart Education, 13 (2), pp. 147-165; Banerjee, A., Chaudhury, S., Statistics without tears: Populations and samples (2010) Industrial Psychiatry Journal, 19 (1), p. 60; Baumgartner, S.E., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Unwanted online sexual solicitation and risky sexual online behavior across the lifespan (2010) Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 31 (6), pp. 439-447; Berchtold, A., Test–Retest: Agreement or reliability?

Utilizing objectification theory, we examined selfie activities (selfie sharing, selfie editing, and selfie investment) in relation to self-objectification and appearance concerns with Imaginary Audience Beliefs (IABs) tested as a moderator of these relations. Participants consisted of 278 14-17-year-old girls residing in the United States. Results showed that selfie editing and selfie investment were related to self-objectification, and indirect relationships of selfie editing and investment on negative appearance concerns (appearance anxiety, body shame, and negative appearance evaluation) through self-objectification were found. However, only limited evidence of IABs as a moderator was found. The simple matter of posting selfies is not consequential for appearance concerns, but overemphasizing the importance of selfies and self-scrutiny through selfie editing are the practices that are potentially problematic for adolescent girls. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","appearance concerns; imaginary audience beliefs; Self-objectification; selfies",,,,,,,,,"Aubrey, J.S., Effects of sexually objectifying media on self-objectification and body surveillance in undergraduates: Results of a 2-year panel study (2006) Journal of Communication, 56 (2), pp. 366-386; Byrne, B.M., (2001) Structural equation modeling with AMOS: Basic concepts, applications, and programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Calogero, R., Dunn, S., Thompson, J.K., Objectification theory: An introduction (2011) Objectification in women, pp. 3-21. , Calogero R., Tantleff-Dunn S., Thompson J.K., (eds), Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, &,.

The content and characters represented on preschool television programs play a role in children’s learning and behavior. The purpose of this content analysis was to investigate role models in television programs targeted toward preschool children, with research questions focusing on gender and race/ethnicity of lead characters, content themes, leadership roles, comparison of public and private networks, and demographics of program creators. One hundred thirty-six programs from public television, cable channels, and private networks/streaming services were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-Square tests of independence. Findings revealed more male than female lead characters and more white, non-Hispanic characters than underrepresented races/ethnicities. Males were more likely than females to be lead characters on programs about STEM and problem-solving. There was a greater proportion of males portrayed as group leaders, corresponding to the greater proportion of male lead characters. Creators of preschool television programs are primarily white and are more often male. Recommendations for improvement of diversity and equality are made. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","content analysis; ethnicity; gender; Preschool; race; television",,,,,,,,,"Aladé, F., Nathanson, A., What preschoolers bring to the show: The relation between viewer characteristics and children’s learning from educational television (2016) Media Psychology, 19 (3), pp. 406-430; Aubrey, J., Harrison, K., The gender-role content of children’s favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions (2004) Media Psychology, 6, pp. 111-146; Auster, C.J., Mansbach, C.S., The gender marketing of toys: An analysis of type of toy on the disney store website (2012) Sex Roles, 67 (7-8), pp. 375-388; Bandura, A., (1977) Social learning theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Barr, R., Lauricella, A., Zack, E., Calvert, S.L., Infant and early childhood exposure to adult-directed and child-directed television programming: Relations with cognitive skills at age four (2010) Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 56, pp. 21-48; Barth, J.M., Hwaheun, E., Cassie, A., Matching abilities to careers for others and self: Do gender stereotypes matter to students in advanced math and science classes?

Little, however, is known about effects in Eastern European settings. Eastern European countries were part of the former USSR and its Soviet regime, meaning that all forms of commercial advertising were prohibited. Current parents and educators experienced the shift to capitalism first-hand and are particularly critical of consumer culture. This study adds to the current body of literature by studying unintended effects on advertising on children in a new context (i.e., Sofia, Bulgaria) and exploring the moderating effects of children’s advertising literacy. We collected data among 273 8- to 11-year-olds and found that advertising exposure increases children’s materialism and consumer involvement. We also found that children’s conceptual advertising literacy buffered the effect on materialism for children with low advertising exposure, but enhanced the effect for children with high advertising exposure. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Based on a case study of 6-16-year-olds’ filmmaking in an out-of-school context, the analysis identifies three interlaced categories marking the production processes: Social interaction, semiotic negotiation and practice-based learning. Results demonstrate that joint creation of new film narratives unleashes students’ playful exploration, trains multimodal skills, and catalyzes modes of reflexivity that are germane to complex problem-solving. In conclusion, it is argued that digital content creation needs added pedagogical attention as a means of advancing children’s democratic rights of expression as societal resources, not as individual requisites. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; Children; children’s rights; digital content creation; digital creativity; film education; filmmaking; media; media literacy; youth media",,,,,,,,,"Ahmadi, N., Besançon, M., Creativity as a stepping stone towards developing other competencies in classrooms (2017) Education research international 2017, pp. 1-9. , https://www.hindawi.com/journals/edri/2017/1357456/, –,).

This article investigates the toy review genre as present in YouTube videos targeting children. This topic has been discussed previously, most notably in regard to digital parenting and child infringement scandals. This analysis aims to more deeply understand the forms and functions of toy reviews in the contexts of YouTube’s political economy, branding and commercialization, as well as regulation. We analyzed the narrative strategies of 180 videos across 35 toy review channels in order to gain an emic understanding of reviewing. Besides producing repetitive content characterized as “kidbait,” these channels also employ creative aims and strategies to convince adults of the benefits of watching. Toy reviews are, however, a complex hybrid genre mediating children’s commodities and play culture, and more attention should be dedicated to the ethical principles of their production. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Little is known, however, regarding prevailing stereotypes associated with older women and men in television programs targeting younger children, especially preschoolers. To fill this gap, the present study examined the salient gendered and ageist stereotypes embedded in the storylines of the well known Cbeebies television show “Grandpa in My Pocket”. By applying qualitative content analysis to 28 episodes of the show’s five seasons, we aimed at answering the following questions: What images of older men and women does this show convey to young children; and what models of social interaction the older adults maintain with other characters. Our findings show that this program actually misses its opportunity to present preschoolers with more positive images of older adults, and especially of older women, who are pictured as weird, bizarre, mean, socially isolated and devaluated. Moreover, the older women are systematically subjected to various forms of “comic violence”, including humiliation, intimidation and physical harm. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","age representation; Cbeebies; content analysis; educational programs; gender stereotypes; Older adults; preschool television programs",,,,,,"Planning and Budgeting Committee of the Council for Higher Education of Israel, PBC

At the same time, the Internet is increasingly being identified as a method of primary prevention and intervention for DMST among youth. However, to-date there are limited examinations of the role of the Internet in the lives of youth who experience DMST victimization. The current study aims to consider the role of the Internet in DMST grooming, exploitation, and exit. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 service providers in North Carolina and Texas. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded line-by-line using a grounded theory approach. Results feature two overarching themes in service provider interviews: 1) Initial exploitation and 2) Exit from exploitation. Within each of these larger themes were subthemes including technology facilitated risk and prevention needs. Overall, these qualitative findings reveal the role of the Internet in: (1) Facilitating DMST, (2) Preventing Internet-facilitated DMST, and (3) Victim exit and survivorship. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children and youth; Domestic minor sex trafficking; Internet; prevention; qualitative",,,,,,"New York Community Trust, NYCT","This work was supported by the New York Community Trust;National Association for Social Work.",,"Adelson, W., Child prostitute or victim of trafficking (2008) University of St. Thomas Law Journal, 6, pp. 96-128; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., (2018) Teens, social media & technology 2018, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/, Pew Research center Internet & Technology, Retrieved from; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., (2018) Teen’s social media habits and experiences, , http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/11/28/teens-social-media-habits-and-experiences/, Pew Research Center Internet & Technology, Retrieved from; Bach, J.E., Litam, S.D.A., “kind regards”: an examination of one buyer's attempt to purchase a trafficked child for sex (2017) Journal of Sexual Aggression, 23 (2), p. 222. , –233; Banks, D., Kyckelhahn, T., (2011) Characteristics of suspected human trafficking incidents, 2008-2010, , Bureau of Justice Statistics: Washington, DC: US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs; Bonanno, G.A., Loss, trauma, and human resilience (2004) Have We Underestimated The Human Capacity to Thrive after Extremely Aversive Events?

Data were collected using questionnaires in several government schools in Bishkek during Spring 2018. Totally 316 children participated in this study. The study employed quantitative methods for the analysis of data. As results showed, there are gender differences in using the Internet. That is, Kyrgyz boys use the Internet for watching videos, and playing games more than Kyrgyz girls. Majority of the participants indicated that they preferred to use the Internet every day mostly from their private bedrooms of homes. Furthermore, a negative linear relationship was found between age and Internet usage. This implies that as the age of children increases, Internet usage decreases. Results also demonstrated that most frequent applications used are WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook. While using the Internet and social networks, most of the participants indicated that they are using smartphones. While participants have basic knowledge about using the Internet, most of them lack specific capabilities. Finally, the study revealed the Kyrgyz parents’ attitudes and perceptions related to the Internet and social networks use of children and adolescents. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","internet; online risks; Social networks",,,,,,,,,"Clark, L.S., Parental mediation theory for the digital age (2011) Communication Theory, 21 (4), pp. 323-343; Collin, P., Rahilly, K., Richardson, I., Third, A., (2011) The benefits of social networking services, , VIC: Cooperative Research Centre for Young People, Technology and Wellbeing, Melbourne; Digital 2019: Kyrgyzstan (2019) PowerPoint slides, , https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2019-kyrgyzstan, Retrieved from; (2018) Kyrgyzstan: State of Affairs report, , https://digital.report/kyrgyzstan-state-of-affairs-report/#_ftn4, Retrieved from; Dogruer, N., Eyyam, R., Menevis, I., The use of the Internet for educational purposes (2011) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 28, pp. 606-611; Haddon, L., Livingstone, S., EU Kids Online: National perspectives (2012) EU Kids Online, , London, UK: The London School of Economics and Political Science; Hamid, S., Waycott, J., Kurnia, S., Chang, S., Understanding students’ perceptions of the benefits of online social networking use for teaching and learning (2015) The Internet and Higher Education, 26, pp. 1-9; Hasebrink, U., Livingstone, S., Haddon, L., Olafsson, K., (2009) Comparing children’s online opportunities and risks across Europe: Cross-national comparisons for EU Kids Online, , LSE, London: EU Kids Online; KYRGYZSTAN (Kyrgyz Republic) (2019) Data file, , https://www.Internetworldstats.com/asia.htm#kg, Retrieved from; Ismailova, R., Muhametjanova, G., Cyber crime risk awareness in Kyrgyz Republic (2016) Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, 25 (1-3), pp. 32-38; (2018) Country profile report, , https://www.itu.int/net4/itu-d/icteye/CountryProfileReport.aspx?countryID=280, Retrieved from; Karakuş, T., Çağıltay, K., Kaşıkcı, D., Kurşun, E., Ogan, C., Türkiye ve Avrupa’daki çocukların Internet alışkanlıkları ve güvenli Internet kullanımı (2014) Eğitim Ve Bilim, 39 (171). , 230–243; Kende, M., Palovirta, M., Coffin, J., Kyrgyz internet environment assessment (2015) PDF file, , https://www.Internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kyrgyzstan_Study.pdf, Retrieved from; Kopecký, K., Czech children and facebook–A quantitative survey (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (4), pp. 950-958; Laplante, P., Michael, B., Voas, J., Cyberpandemics: History, inevitability, response (2009) IEEE Security and Privacy, 7 (1), pp. 63-67; Livingstone, S., Helsper, E.J., Parental mediation of children’s internet use (2008) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 52 (4), pp. 581-599; Livingstone, S., Mascheroni, G., Staksrud, E., (2015) Developing a framework for researching children’s online risks and opportunities in Europe, , London: EU Kids Online; Livingstone, S., Stoilova, M., Yu, S.-H., Byrne, J., Kardefelt-Winther, D., Using mixed methods to research children’s online opportunities and risks in a global context: The approach of Global Kids Online (2018) Sage methods cases (Sociology), SAGE research methods cases, , http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/84711/, London: Sage, Retrieved from, &,.

It involved four-year-old children (30 boys and 30 girls) who were randomly allocated to a virtual reality group, a video group, or a picture book group. Each child was individually presented with three impossible and three matched possible events using their assigned medium. After each event, children were asked whether it was possible in real life and why/why not. Children in the VR group were more likely to correctly judge the possibility of possible events than children in the video group and they were more likely to incorrectly judge the possibility of impossible events than children in the video group. Furthermore, they were more likely to correctly judge the possibility of possible events than impossible events. The results suggest that virtual reality affects four-year-old children’s understanding of possibility and impossibility.

Sexting is one of the ways in which this exploration occurs, often on a consensual basis. In a first stage, this article reflects on the concepts of trust, control and privacy as prerequisites to engage in sexting. In a second stage, the authors explore the extent to which legislative instruments enable the legitimate exploration and expression of one’s sexual identity, and aim to minimise adverse consequences thereof. To that end, the fundamental right to privacy, data protection frameworks and criminal legislation on the non-consensual dissemination of sexual images were identified as potentially harnessing the concepts of trust, control and privacy. Questions were examined regarding the potential undermining thereof through the application of child sexual abuse material legislation to instances of (consensual) sexting between children. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; Children; control; Lanzarote Convention; privacy; sexting; trust",,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO: FWO.OPR.2017.0024.01","This work was supported by the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [FWO.OPR.2017.0024.01].",,"Albury, K., Just because it’s public doesn’t mean it’s any of your business: Adults’ and children’s sexual rights in digitally mediated spaces (2017) New Media & Society, 19 (5), pp. 713-725; Baier, A., Trust and antitrust (1986) Ethics, 96 (2), pp. 231-260; Boyd, D., (2014) It’s complicated, , https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300199000/its-complicated, Yale University Press, Retrieved from,.

The analysis of two case studies of popular teen YouTubers from Portugal and Brazil–SofiaBBeauty and Manoela Antelo, respectively–revealed that their presentation is anchored in discourses about whom they are with and where they are, what they are doing, and their personal tastes and styles. Through their comments on the videos, followers express trust connections with the vloggers, based on a sense of proximity, a desire for exclusivity in their relationship, relatability with banal aspects, and recognition as cultural intermediaries. These case studies have demonstrated strong similarities in the vloggers’ practices of constructing intimacy and consequent trust with peer audiences, bearing great resemblance with older YouTubers from central cultures. Although Sofia and Manoela put forward different class performances, the trust they inspire in their followers is a fundamental form of capital for both. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","girlhood; influencer; intimacy; Micro-celebrity; teenagers; trust; vlogger; youth; YouTube; YouTuber",,,,,,,,,"Abidin, C., Cyber-BFFs: Assessing women’s ‘perceived interconnectedness’ in Singapore’s commercial lifestyle blog industry (2013) Global Media Journal Australian Edition, 7 (1). , https://www.hca.westernsydney.edu.au/gmjau/?p=217, Retrieved from; Abidin, C., Communicative <3 intimacies: Influencers and perceived interconnectedness (2015) Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology, 8. , https://adanewmedia.org/2015/11/issue8-abidin/, Retrieved from; Andò, R., The ordinary celebrity: Italian young vloggers and the definition of girlhood (2016) Film, Fashion & Consumption, 5 (1), pp. 123-139; Aran, O., Biel, J.I., Gatica-Perez, D., Broadcasting oneself: Visual discovery of vlogging styles (2014) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 16 (1), pp. 201-215; Arthus, J., Drakopoulou, S., Gandini, A., Researching YouTube (2018) Convergence, 24 (1), pp. 3-15; Bakioğlu, B.S., Exposing convergence: YouTube, fan labour, and anxiety of cultural production in Lonelygirl15 (2018) Convergence, 24 (2), pp. 184-204; Banet-Weiser, S., Branding the post-feminist self: Girls’ video-production and YouTube (2011) Mediated girlhoods: New explorations of girls’ media culture, pp. 277-294. , Kearney M.C., (ed), New York, NY: Peter Lang,.

Children do have a right to the protection of their personal data and, according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), even merit specific protection. Children should be clearly informed of and understand what happens with their data when it is collected, processed, stored and transferred. To that end, specific transparency standards require the provision of information in a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand. In this article, after having mapped these existing requirements, the privacy policies of Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok — services which are very popular with children — are evaluated. The findings suggest that such policies are still complex, long and primarily text based. In order to improve this, possible practical ways of enhancing transparency for children such as legal visualization, co-design, co-creation techniques and participatory design methods which focus on presenting legal information in a transparent and clear manner are explored. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children; co-creation; co-design; data protection; European Union; GDPR; Instagram; privacy policy; Snapchat; TikTok; transparency",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Opinion 03/2013 on purpose limitation, , https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2013/wp203_en.pdf, April, Retrieved from; (2018) Guidelines on transparency under regulation 2016/679 (WP260 rev.01), , http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=622227, April, 11, Retrieved from; Berger-Walliser, G., Barton, T.D., Haapio, H., From visualization to legal design: A collaborative and creative process: From visualization to legal design (2017) American Business Law Journal, 54 (2), pp. 347-392; Brunschwig, C.R., (2013) Law is not or must not be just verbal and visual in the 21st century: Toward multisensory law, , https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2323281, Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network, Retrieved from; (2017) Growing up Digital.

This article relies on two datasets from Norway: A small-scale exploratory survey and focus groups with children at one school in Norway; and the EU Kids Online survey with a nationally representative sample of Norwegian Internet-using children, to examine whether children and young people aged 9–19 are aware of and whether they use social media companies’ mechanisms against cyberbullying (e.g., various types of reporting, blocking, and companies’ safety and help centers). We also examine the extent to which children find these tools to be helpful and the underlying reasons for such perceptions of the effectiveness of social media companies’ mechanisms. The study further inquires into children’s perceptions of company responsibility for providing assistance in bullying incidents. While the majority of children in both samples know how to use basic tools such as reporting, the levels of awareness of various companies’ advanced tools as well as the use of these, are relatively low. Children also have mixed perceptions as to whether companies are able to assist.

When adopting a parental mediation style, they are challenged by a dilemma: protecting their children often means invading their privacy and restricting their options. The adopted parental mediation style is pondered according to the perceptions and experiences of parents regarding digital media; it is an ongoing and dynamic negotiation between the actions of parents and children. Our research focuses on mobile apps, since the favourite devices of young children are smartphones and tablets, in order to explore how parents and children select apps, and which criteria they use. Our fieldwork was conducted in Portugal and used a mixed method, combining an online survey to a purposive sample of 1955 parents of children under 8 years old, and separate interviews to parents and children under 8 to a purposive sample of 81 families. Our results reveal how parents are coping with contrasting perceptions on digital media and how they negotiate their parental mediation style in interaction with their children. Parents believe more in building trust than in restricting children, but when they find it necessary, their will to protect overcomes their respect for the children’s privacy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digital media; Digital technologies; parental mediation; perceptions; privacy; trust; young children",,,,,,,"This work was supported by CECC/CRC-W, Universidade Cat?lica Portuguesa and by Centro Internet Segura, Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e Tecnologia.",,"Aboim, S., Vasconcelos, P., Wall, K., Support, social networks and the family in Portugal: Two decades of research (2013) International Review of Sociology, 23 (1), pp. 47-67; (2018) Relatório Trimestral sobre Comunicações Móveis, 3º Trimestre de 2018, , http://twixar.me/zRVK, Retrieved from; Boyatzis, R., (1995) Transforming qualitative information: Analysis and code development, , London: Sage; Brito, R., Dias, P., A participação ética de crianças com menos de 8 anos em investigação qualitativa [The ethical participation of children under 8 years old in qualitative research] (2017) Revista EDaPECi, 17 (2), pp. 16-29. , https://goo.gl/dnYhNH, Retrieved from; Brito, R., Dias, P., (2018) hAPPy kids: Aplicações seguras e benéficas para crianças felizes–Perspetivas das Famílias, , Lisboa: Centro de Estudos em Comunicação e Cultura, Universidade Católica Portuguesa; Brito, R., Dias, P., Francisco, R., Chaudron, S., Family dynamics in digital homes: The role played by parental mediation in young children´s digital practices around 14 European countries (2017) Contemporary Family Therapy, 39 (4), pp. 271-280; Crescendo entre ecrãs: Competências digitais de crianças de três a oito anos (2017) ERC - Entidade Reguladora para a Comunicação Social, , http://bit.do/fgWMA, Retrieved from; Chaudron, S., Beutel, M.E., Černikova, M., Donoso Navarette, V., Dreier, M., Fletcher-Watson, B., Wölfling, K., (2015) Young children (0–8) and digital technology: A qualitative exploratory study across seven countries, , JRC 93239/EUR 27052, …,.

Yet, factors associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the importance of their identification for intervention purposes. It stands to reason that parents can influence child MTSD use, via their attitudes, beliefs, role-modelling, and style of parenting. Here, we examined the associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD use and whether parenting styles specifically with regard to child MTSD use exist. Hungarian parents (N = 1283) were surveyed about their children’s digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regarding the child’s MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct “digital parenting styles” were identified and these resembled general parenting styles. Findings further suggested that children spent more time with MTSD use if their parents: were more permissive, more authoritative and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes towards, and attributed less harm and more benefits to, early device use. These results are the first evidence for existence of digital parenting styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential prevention and treatment targets. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

We applied a social network approach to assess the role of close peers in adolescent pornography use and sexting in a sample of Croatian high school students. Sexual conversation networks’ characteristics did not correlate with pornography use. In contrast, sexting was associated with the proportion of same gender peers, the proportion of older peers and the proportion of sexually experienced peers in the network–pointing to the role of peer influence. Participants’ gender did not moderate these associations. Specific mechanisms underlying the observed associations and the role of peer selection remain important tasks for future research. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescents; gender; peer networks; pornography use; sexting",,,,,,"Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ: 9221","This work was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation, project grant #9221.",,"Abrahamson, E., Rosenkopf, L., Social network effects on the extent of innovation diffusion: A computer simulation (1997) Organization Science, 8 (3), pp. 289-309; Ajilore, O., Identifying peer effects using spatial analysis: The role of peers on risky sexual behavior (2015) Review of Economics of the Household, 13 (3), pp. 635-652; Ali, M.M., Dwyer, D.S., Estimating peer effects in sexual behavior among adolescents (2011) Journal of Adolescence, 34 (1), pp. 183-190; Baćak, V., Štulhofer, A., Masturbation among sexually active young women in Croatia: Associations with religiosity and pornography use (2011) International Journal of Sexual Health, 23 (4), pp. 248-257; Barrense-Dias, Y., Berchtold, A., Surís, J.-C., Akre, C., Sexting and the definition issue (2017) Journal of Adolescent Health, 61 (5), pp. 544-554; Baumeister, R.F., Stillman, T.F., Erotic plasticity: Nature, culture, gender, and sexuality (2006) Sex and sexuality, 3. , McAnulty R.D., Burnette M.M., (eds), Westport: CT, &,.

Although child-friendly contact visits with ample opportunities for physical contact are the most meaningful way for young children to connect with their incarcerated parents during times of health, there are other meaningful ways of connecting from a distance. Traditional mediated communication strategies such as phone calls and letters are challenging for very young children because of their limited cognitive, language, and attentional capabilities. New forms of mediated communication, such as in-home video chat, can be accessible and developmentally appropriate for connecting young children with family members who live at a distance, including connecting children with their incarcerated parents. A growing body of international developmental research suggests that video chat may afford children the ability to maintain the benefits of parent-child interactions from a distance, when internet access is available. Thus, in-home video chat between children and their incarcerated parents is a potentially viable option for building relationships during incarceration, especially when opportunities for positive physical contact are limited or non-existent. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Child development; communication; corrections; incarcerated parent; video chat",,,,,,,,,"Media and young minds (2016) Pediatrics, 138 (5), p. e20162591; Ames, M.G., Go, J., Kaye, J.J., Spasojevic, M., Making love in the network closet: The benefits and work of family videochat (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work, pp. 145-154. , February, ACM), &,.

Drawing on 71 parent and 37 teacher interviews from a large-scale Canadian study examining summer learning loss in Ontario through summer literacy and numeracy programs for students (grades 1–3), this study highlights the complexities associated with using digital tool in both home and school life in the summer. Through extensions of Bourdieu’s theory of cultural capital, we suggest that digital tools are becoming a new type of valued skillset that parents and educators are acknowledging. In specific, our main findings center around three interrelated themes: i) comfort with technology; ii) home-school connections; and iii) perception of children as digital natives. Results may be fruitful for parents, educators, and policymakers to understand the larger role that digital technology plays amongst Canadian families and teachers during the summer months and school year. Capturing these discussions can maximize both school and home use of digital tools. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children; Digital technology; families; parent engagement; social class; summer learning",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, K.L., Entwisle, D.R., Olson, L.S., Lasting consequences of the summer learning gap (2007) American Sociological Review, 72 (2), pp. 167-180; Anderson, M., Jiang, J., (2018) Teens, social media and technology, , http://publicservicesalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teens-Social-Media-Technology-2018-PEW.pdf, Pew Research Center; Armstrong, E., Hamilton, L., (2013) Paying for the party: How college maintains inequality, , Harvard University Press, &,.

The objective of this study was to examine cross-sectional associations between family stress and media parenting practices. Using the Guelph Family Health Study Pilot 2 cohort, data was collected from 64 parents from 39 families. Linear regression using generalized estimating equations was used to examine associations between family-based stress and screen parenting practices, stratified by mothers and fathers. Models were adjusted for household income, the number of children in the family, child sex, and age. General stress was positively associated with mothers’ use of screen-based devices in front of their child(ren) and negatively associated with mothers’ monitoring and limit-setting. Fathers’ general stress was positively associated with limit-setting. Parenting distress was positively associated with mothers’ modeling screen use. Fathers’ parenting distress was negatively associated with limit-setting and positively associated with mealtime screen use. Household chaos was positively associated with monitoring screen-time for both mothers and fathers and positively associated with fathers’ limit-setting. These results suggest that associations between family stress and media parenting practices differ among mothers and fathers. Programs aimed to reduce children’s screen-time should consider these differences in their messaging to parents. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","chaos; family; media; parenting practices; screens; Stress",,,,,,"University of Guelph, U of G

Bringing together discourses of girlhoods and Latinidad, and elaborating on post-feminism through ambiguity, the article employs three overlapping units of analysis: the family, the main character, Harley Diaz, and four purposefully selected episodes, to investigate how mainstream cultural producers attempt to represent and reach out to a newly acknowledged diverse audience. Disney, as a major player among mainstream US media industries, functions in relation to demographic shifts as these impinge upon markets and circulation of products. This article makes an intervention into the conundrum between a mainstream producer claiming they are representing Latinidad, and the ethnic audience’s demands for visibility which results in a tension between identifiable presence and stereotypical depictions. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Disney; Disney Channel; girlhood; latina/o Studies; stuck in the Middle; television",,,,,,,,,"Banet-Weiser, S., (2018) Empowered: Popular feminism and popular misogyny, , Durham: Duke University Press; Banet-Weiser, S., Gill, R., Rottenberg, C., Postfeminism, popular feminism and neoliberal feminism?

We analysed the data obtained from the Kids Online survey in Chile. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify groups based on access points and devices of use; access modalities were then composed crossing these variables. Four access modalities were found: cellphone-home; cellphone-ubiquitous; multi-device-home; multi-device-ubiquitous. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ubiquitous modalities (multi-device and cellphone varieties) predicted digital use and skills among young Chileans, while the more static modalities (cellphone and home and multi-device and home) did not. These results are critical to addressing what can be defined as “enabling access” among young Internet users in the context of digital inclusion policies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; children; digital divide; digital skills; digital uses; Internet access",,,,,,,,,"Arteaga, A.C., Martuccelli, D., Neoliberalismo, corporativismo y experiencias posicionales: Los casos de Chile y Francia (2012) Revista Mexicana de Sociología, 74 (2), pp. 275-302; Ayanso, A., Cho, D.I., Lertwachara, K., Information and communications technology development and the digital divide: A global and regional assessment (2014) Information Technology for Development, 20 (1), pp. 60-77; Balea, B., The role of smartphones in increasing digital and social inequalities among Romanian children (2016) Journal of Comparative Research in Anthropology and Sociology, 7 (2), pp. 1-20; Banaji, S., Livingstone, S., Nandi, A., Stoilova, M., Instrumentalising the digital: Adolescents’ engagement with ICTs in low-and middle-income countries (2018) Development in Practice, 28 (3), pp. 432-443; Bourdieu, P., (1997) Capital cultural, escuela y espacio social, , México, D.F.: Siglo XXI; Boyd, D., (2014) It’s complicated: The social lives of networked teens, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Büchi, M., Just, N., Latzer, M., Modeling the second-level digital divide: A five-country study of social differences in internet use (2016) New Media & Society, 18 (11), pp. 2703-2722; Cabello, P., Claro, M., Lazcano, D., Antezana, L., La inclusión digital de niños y adolescentes chilenos desde la perspectiva de usos y habilidades (2018) Oportunidades y Riesgos de los Menores en Internet, pp. 55-85. , Jiménez E., Casado M., Garmendia M., (eds), España: Editorial GEDISA/Universidad del País Vasco, &, [Digital Inclusion of children and adolescents from the perspective of uses and skills].

Yet contemporary digital media complicate the task of the good parent who is expected to not only know where their children are and what they’re doing, but also what they’re doing online and with digital media. This article draws on qualitative research with forty Australian parents of teenagers to determine the various ways that parents monitored and acquired knowledge about their children’s online activities. Five primary techniques were identified: 1) physical observation; 2) digital surveillance; 3) trust-based and discursive strategies; 4) restriction and control through social or technical means, and 5) talking with other parents. This article contributes to parental mediation literature by exploring what parents know about their children’s online activities, and how they acquire those knowledges. This article points to a number of challenges experienced by parents in monitoring and mediating their children’s online activities, and argues that parents are defaulting to trust-based and discursive strategies as other forms of mediation fail. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Digital media; parental anxieties; parental knowledges; parental mediation; parental monitoring; parenting",,,,,,,,,"Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Carr-Gregg, M., (2007) Caught in the net, , https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/caught-in-the, 3, December, Retrieved from,.

Physician mediation theory, an adaptation of parental mediation theory, suggests that physician-patient discussion about media content (e.g., online searches) directly shapes patient engagement with said content. Little attention has been paid though as to how guidance about children’s media use is delivered to parents by pediatric clinical professionals and its utility from the perspective of diverse families. Interviews and home observations were conducted with families of 26 children ages 3–13 on the autism spectrum. Two main social contexts for media guidance were identified: advising on children’s media use 1) as part of therapy and 2) as recreation. Prior research indicates that physician mediation takes three forms: positive (encouraging media use), negative (discouraging), and redirective (suggesting alternatives). Within the two contexts, positive physician mediation was more prominent in therapeutic than recreational contexts. Poor and working-class families also tended to report media guidance less than upper- and middle-class families, partly due to barriers in accessing clinical care.

To test these hypotheses, a survey was distributed in the United States among primary caregivers of children ages 4 through 11 (K–5th grade). In it, we provided parents with layperson descriptions of five common media effect outcomes: fear, cultivation, desensitization, aggression, and hostility. For each violent media effect, caregivers provided their beliefs about the perceived severity and susceptibility for their oldest child in the K-5th grade range while focusing on one of three media: television, movies, or video games. Results suggest parents view their children as most susceptible to fear and cultivation outcomes, but not aggression and hostility. On the other hand, they perceived aggression and hostility to be the most severe. Consistent with the EPPM, ratings of susceptibility and severity predicted overall anxiety about media violence effects.

First, it explicated each effect of the four main components of digital literacy such as technical skills, information usage, communication and creation. A nationwide survey of more than 2,500 South Korean students showed that all components but technical skills were significant predictors of various activities of engagement. Information usage was the most salient predictor of posting on social issues and donation, while creation was highly related to volunteering. Next, we tested if there were any salient differences among the low, medium and high-news attention groups. Digital literacy components were significantly related to engagement among high-news attention respondents. In the low-attention group, however, the variables rarely predicted participation. The differences among groups were coherent across various engagement variables. This study demonstrates that frequency and amount of time spent on social media does not automatically guarantee adolescents’ civic engagement. Competence and attitude under the broader umbrella of digital literacy are what really matter. The normative and practical implication for digital literacy education and the function of news regarding the connection between digital literacy and engagement were further discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","civic engagement; Digital literacy; news attention; social media; youth participation",,,,,,,,,"Aufderheide, P., Media literacy.

However, despite intense public discourse, we have little empirical evidence on how technology use impacts on children’s development across a number of psycho-social domains. Research that has been conducted tends to be largely small-scale or cross-sectional in nature and most often focused on (young) adults rather than children. Using longitudinal data on one-in-eight Irish children, we use econometric methods to test for associations between early mobile phone ownership and two measures of children’s psycho-social development between 9 and 13 years of age. We examine the Piers Harris Self-Concept Scale, reported by children, and the Strengths and Difficulties (SDQ) score, completed by the primary caregiver. We find no generalised associations between early mobile phone ownership and psycho-social outcomes. However, there is evidence that associations differ by gender and across psycho-social sub-domains. We find no robust associations affecting boys, but girls who receive phones earlier fare less well in terms of their behavioural adjustment and academic self-concept scores at 13 years of age, all else being equal. Further research is needed to identify causal mechanisms and explore possible mediating effects of family/social context. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gender; longitudinal data; Mobile phone ownership; Piers Harris; psychological adjustment; SDQ; self-concept",,,,,,"Deparment of Children and Youth Affairs, Ireland, DCYA","We are grateful for funding from the ESRI Programme of Research in Communications, which is in turn is funded by contributions from Ireland’s Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Commission on Communications Regulation (ComReg).

Consequently, consumption of Disney’s media products tend to be an uncritical process. While a preferred decoding of Zootopia recognizes in its characters and story an affirmation of racial diversity and girl power, the film’s polysemy conveys other latent messages that emerge through a negotiated reading. This paper focuses on the discourses within Zootopia that promote neoliberal values such as consumerism, individualism, and “small government.” An analysis of the text reveals that Zootopia constructs an ideal citizen who obeys the law, performs their consumptive duties, believes in the capitalist myth of the American Dream, and happily accepts simulacra as substitute for reality. Furthermore, this paper makes the argument that Zootopia functions as a feature-length advertisement, not only for consumer products per se, but in a broader sense, for the consumerist lifestyle. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Advertising; children; consumer citizenship; consumerism; Disney; identity; media literacy; neoliberalism; socialization; Zootopia",,,,,,,,,"Andrews, D.L., Disneyization, Debord, and the integrated NBA spectacle (2006) Social Semiotics, 16 (1), pp. 89-102; Andrews, M., Chapman, B., Purcell, S., (2012) Brave, , Directors), [Motion Picture], United States: Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios; Banet-Weiser, S., Lapsansky, C., RED is the new black: Brand culture, consumer citizenship and political possibility (2008) International Journal of Communication, 2, pp. 1248-1268; Beaudine, G., Osibodu, O., Beavers, A., Disney’s metaphorical exploration of racism and stereotypes: A review of Zootopia (2017) Comparative Education Review, 61 (1), pp. 227-234; Boorstin, J., (2019) What’s next for media in 2019 as apple, Disney, AT&T and more jump into the streaming business, , https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/julia-boorstins-digital-media-predictions-for-2019.html, January, 4, Retrieved from CNBC Web site; Brenner, N., Theodore, N., Neoliberalism and the urban condition (2005) City, 9 (1), pp. 101-107; Buck, C., Lee, J., (2013) Frozen, , Directors), [Motion Picture], United States: Walt Disney Animation Studios; Cho, J., Keum, H., Shah, D.V., News consumers, opinion leaders, and citizen consumers: Moderators of the consumption-participation link (2015) Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, 91 (1), pp. 161-178; Clements, R., Musker, J., (1989) The Little Mermaid, , Directors), [Motion Picture], United States: Walt Disney Pictures; Davis, A.M., (2015) Handsome heroes & vile villains: Men in disney’s feature animation, , Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press; Debord, G., (1994) The society of the spectacle, , New York: Zone Books; deCordova, R., The mickey in macy’s window: Childhood, consumerism, and disney animation (1994) Disney discourse: Producing the magic kingdom, pp. 203-213. , Smoodin E., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge,.

This paper explores a way to address this issue through the use of smartphone data in ethnographic research. It puts forward an updated, case study approach that serves youth and media researchers by focusing robustly on social relationships and connectivity. To illustrate the method, I walk through my collaborative fieldwork with JayVon, an eighteen-year-old from Harlem (New York, N.Y.). I demonstrate what the inclusion of each layer of smartphone data allowed me to understand about JayVon that contributes to key lines of children and media research on presence, screen time, and media curation. After showing how the ecology of a case opens up naturally by analyzing smartphone data ethnographically, I discuss the significant, ethical challenges concerning access to such intimate data and how case researchers can establish suitable study boundaries with youth. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; connectivity; ethnography; network; presence; screen time; Smartphone",,,,,,,,,"Alper, M., Katz, V.S., Clark, L.S., Researching children, intersectionality, and diversity in the digital age (2016) Journal of Children and Media, 10 (1), pp. 107-114; Anderson, E., (1990) Streetwise, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Benediktsson, M.O., Alexander, D., Bermeo, J., Contreras, J., Kingston, B., Harper, W., Williams, A., Hybrid strategies: Allocating involvement in the digital age (2015) Symbolic Interaction, 38 (3), pp. 331-351. , …; boyd, D., Networked privacy (2012) Surveillance & Society, 10 (3-4), pp. 348-350; Burrell, J., The field site as a network: A strategy for locating ethnographic research (2009) Field Methods, 21 (2), pp. 181-199; Campbell, S.W., Park, Y.J., Predictors of mobile sexting among teens: Toward a new explanatory framework (2014) Mobile Media & Communication, 2 (1), pp. 20-39; Davis, K., Extreme social isolation of a child (1940) American Journal of Sociology, 45, pp. 554-565; Duneier, M., Kasinitz, P., Murphy, A.K., (2014) The urban ethnography reader, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press, &, (Eds; Feagin, J.R., Orum, A.M., Sjoberg, G., (1991) A case for the case study, , Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, &, (Eds; Fine, M., Weis, L., Writing the ‘wrongs’ of fieldwork: Confronting our own research/writing dilemmas in urban ethnographies (1996) Qualitative Inquiry, 2 (3), pp. 251-274; Geiger, R.S., Ribes, D., Trace ethnography: Following coordination through documentary practices (2011) Proceedings of the 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2011), pp. 1-10. , Los Alamitos, CA; Goffman, E., Embarrassment and social organization (1956) American Journal of Sociology, 62, pp. 264-271; Harrison, K., Rude or shrewd?

Largely absent from the research to date, however, are the voices of young people themselves on whether they find media ratings practices to be fair, accurate, and effective. Like many features of the media landscape, the current ratings systems may be taken for granted in the absence of media literacy education that specifically calls for their analysis and critique. In this qualitative study, 58 early adolescents provide open-ended responses to a number of questions designed to measure their views about media ratings and labels used in the U.S. within the context of an in-school media literacy program. Responses show that students learned from the media literacy discussions, applying concepts introduced, using logical reasoning to support their views, and expressing varying levels of critique of current ratings systems. Implications for the ability of early adolescents to use ratings to regulate their own media use are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","forbidden fruit;

With this success there has been concern about the influence these princesses have on preadolescent girls’ lives and their self-esteem. The purpose of this study was to ask preadolescent girls why there is such a strong attraction toward, adoration for, and devotion to the Disney Princesses. The study was conducted using Q methodology, a behavioral research approach that allows for the measurement of attitudes, opinions, and beliefs. The results produced four factors labeled The Virtuous, who looked at the princesses’ positive personality attributes, The Royalists who liked the princesses because of their beauty, gowns, and royal status, The Dreamers who seemed to yearn for the princesses’ lifestyle and creating a better life for themselves, and The Grrrls who liked the princesses who were confident and strong. Overall, this study indicates that preadolescent girls do not take the princesses at face value and recognized the actions and behaviors of the princesses first. They see beyond the physical attributes of the princesses and understand they do not have to be beautiful to be confident and kind to others. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","audience; Disney; girls; princess; Q methodology",,,,,,,,,"(2007) Report of the APA task force on the sexualization of girls, , http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf, Retrieved from; Benowitz-Fredericks, C.A., Garcia, K., Massey, M., Vasagar, B., Borzekowski, D.L.G., Body image, eating disorders, and the relationship to adolescent media use (2012) Pediatric Clinics of North America, 59 (3), pp. 693-704; Berman, E., (2016) Why Disney decided to make Moana the ultimate anti-princess, , http://time.com/4473277/moana-disney-princess-directors-interview/, Retrieved from; Best, J., Lowney, K.S., The disadvantage of a good reputation: Disney as a target for social problems claims (2009) The Sociological Quarterly, 50, pp. 431-449; Brown, S.R., (1980) Political subjectivity, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Brown, S.R., A primer on Q methodology (1993) Operant Subjectivity, 16 (3-4), pp. 91-138; Bruce, A.M., Princesses without a prince: A consideration of girls’ reactions to Disney’s “princess” movies (2018) Children’s Folklore Review, 28, pp. 7-22; Coyne, S.M., Linder, J.R., Rasmussen, E.E., Nelson, D.A., Birkbeck, V., Pretty as a Princess: Longitudinal effects of engagement with Disney princesses on gender stereotypes, body esteem, and prosocial behavior in children (2016) Child Development, 87 (6), pp. 1909-1925; Dakanalis, A., Carrà, G., Calogero, R., Fida, R., Clerici, M., Zanetti, M.A., Riva, G., The developmental effects of media-ideal internalization and self-objectification processes on adolescents’ negative body-feelings, dietary restraint, and binge eating (2015) European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry; New York, 24 (8), pp. 997-1010; Davis, A.M., The “dark prince” and dream women: Walt Disney and mid-twentieth century American feminism (2005) Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, 25 (2), pp. 213-230; Davis, A.M., (2006) Good girls & wicked witches: Women in Disney’s feature animation, , Hertfordshire, UK: John Libbey Publishing; Davis, A.M., (2013) Handsome heroes & vile villains: Men in Disney’s feature animation, , Herfordshire, UK: John Libbey Publishing; Disney, W., Bailey, A., (1950) Cinderella [Motion Picture, , United States: Disney Studios; Do Rozario, R.C., The princess and the magic kingdom: Beyond nostalgia, the function of the Disney princess (2004) Women’s Studies In Communication, 27 (1), pp. 34-59; Ehrenreich, B., (2007) Bonfire of the Disney princesses, , http://www.thenation.com/article/bonfire-disney-princesses, Retrieved from; England, D.E., Descartes, L., Collier-Meek, M.A., Gender role portrayal and the Disney princesses (2011) Sex Roles, 64, pp. 555-567; Garabedian, J., Animating gender roles: How Disney is redefining the modern princess (2014) James Madison Undergraduate Research Journal, 2 (1), pp. 22-25; Garlen, J.C., Sandlin, J.A., Happily (n)ever after: The cruel optimism of Disney’s romantic ideal (2017) Feminist Media Studies, 17 (6), pp. 957-971; Ginsburg, H., Opper, S., (1969) Piaget’s theory of intellectual development, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Giroux, H.A., (1999) The mouse that roared: Disney and the end of innocence, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Giroux, H.A., Pollock, G., Is Disney good for your kids?

Fifty-one children (12, 24, 36 mos) played in a furnished observation lab for 30 min without BTV and 30 min with BTV (order counterbalanced across participants). Parents were instructed to act as they normally would during leisure time. The findings revealed an indirect negative effect of BTV on the proportion of time that 12- and 24-month-old children played with toys, which was completely mediated by parents’ active engagement in their child’s play. These effects were not observed for 36-month-olds who had more (rather than less) play in the presence of BTV. Moreover, parents’ overall disengagement (regardless of engagement quality) did not mediate the effect of BTV on toddlers’ play. That is, the quality of parent engagement mattered more than the overall quantity of engagement for the youngest children. These findings provide further evidence for the importance of considering social context and individual characteristics when examining the impact of screen media on play. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Background television; parent engagement; parent-child interaction; toddlers; toy play",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: BCS-0111811, BCS-0519197

We tested whether co-viewer supported face-to-face live interactions uniquely promote 24- to 36-month-old children’s participation and learning compared to co-viewer supported on-screen video chat interactions. An adult co-viewer explained the relevance of a social partner’s information and helped children see the partner as connected to real events and objects. Results showed that the partner condition impacted learning: children learned and transferred more novel words in the live condition compared to the video chat condition, and this difference was greatest for younger children. However, children participated similarly with live and video chat partners: there were no differences in imitating actions and responding promptly to the partner’s bids. Results therefore demonstrated that even when children experience media with a supportive co-viewer and even when they interact with the on-screen information, they nevertheless learn more from live interactions compared to video chat interactions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","co-viewing; cognitive development; early childhood; joint media engagement; screen time; social interaction; transfer deficit; Video chat; word learning",,,,,,"Lehigh University","This work was funded by professional development funds to the first author from the Lafayette College Provost?s Office, and by EXCEL Scholar research assistantships to the second and third authors from the Lafayette College Academic Research Committee.

Here, children were asked to learn ten new words in a narrative mobile game that requires children use knowledge of word meanings to advance the game. Study 1 used a lab-based between-subjects design with middle-SES 4-year-olds and used a receptive vocabulary test to examine whether children learned the game’s words. Children who played the game answered more questions correctly than children who did not play the game. Study 2 used a within-subjects design with low-SES preschoolers who played the game four times as part of a larger classroom intervention. Children showed evidence of learning on both a receptive and an expressive vocabulary measure. The difference between pre- and post-test scores was significantly larger for target words than for five non-exposure control words. Results show that both middle-SES children in the lab and low-SES children in the classroom learned new vocabulary from an interactive mobile game, suggesting that developmentally-appropriate mobile games show promise for vocabulary learning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","app; classroom; digital game; learning; Mobile game; narrative; preschool; vocabulary",,,,,,,,,"Bååth, R., ChildFreq: An online tool to explore word frequencies in child language (2010) LUCS Minor, 16, pp. 1-6; Beck, I.L., McKeown, M.G., Increasing young low-income children’s oral vocabulary repertoires through rich and focused instruction (2007) Elementary School Journal, 107, pp. 251-271; Biemiller, A., (2010) Words worth teaching: Closing the vocabulary gap, , Columbus, OH: SRA/McGraw-Hill; Brittain, L., Crawford, J.B., Schapiro, S., Paratore, J.R., Salinas, A., O’Brien, L., Blodgett, S.D., Building learning pathways and community for early childhood educators (2019) Getting ready to learn: Creating effective, educational children’s media, pp. 45-60. , Pasnik S., (ed), New York: Routledge, &,.

An experiment examined the implications of these depictions for children’s learning and transfer of scientific information. Preschoolers viewed two videos about insect communication from a popular children’s television show that contained either realistic or anthropomorphic visuals of insects. Results indicated that initial learning from the show did not differ between conditions. However, one week later, children who viewed the show with realistic visuals were more likely to transfer what they learned to real insects, whereas children who viewed the show with anthropomorphic visuals were more likely to attribute humanlike characteristics to real insects. Contrary to predictions, these effects were not mediated by children’s attention to the show or their reality judgments of the factual content. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anthropomorphism; children; pictorial realism; science television; transfer",,,,,,,,,"Aladé, F., Character portrayals in STEM-focused educational television shows and their impact on children’s attitudes towards STEM (2018) dissertation, , https://search.proquest.com/openview/13a89abfa6ebc99529561c62cf2242ee/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL: Retrieved from; Aladé, F., Lauricella, A.R., Beaudoin-Ryan, L., Wartella, E., Measuring with Murray: Touchscreen technology and preschoolers’ STEM learning (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 62, pp. 433-441; Bachrach, E.R., Grant, M., Goodman, I.F., (2012), Goodman Research Group, Inc, &,).

The current study examined the extent to which 2- to 4-year-old children’s media exposure related to their receptive vocabulary, and whether parent education and attitudes about television as beneficial or harmful to learning, or having no impact, mediated relations between child media exposure and receptive vocabulary. Findings suggested that book reading positively and background television negatively relate to receptive vocabulary, whereas exposure to child-centric foreground television programming is unrelated. Parent attitudes significantly mediated positive relations between book reading and receptive vocabulary. In contrast, parent education significantly mediated negative relations between background television exposure and receptive vocabulary.

Studies were mostly based on parents’ reports and ignored other major caregivers, particularly grandparents. Accordingly, this study offers a pioneer exploration of young children’s interactive and non-interactive media use under their grandparent’s care and the factors associated with extensive use. The study was based on an online survey of 356 grandparents of children aged 2–7, who reported taking care of their grandchildren at least once a week. The study shows that children spend about half of the time under their grandparents’ watch using various media. Use time increased with age and was higher among boys compared to girls. Non-interactive media use was explained by place and duration of care, number of parents’ instructions, bringing a mobile device to the grandparent’s home, having the television on in the background, and grandparents’ mediation efforts. Interactive media use was explained by duration of care and grandparent’s sex, with male grandparents contributing to longer use. These findings raise concerns regarding young children’s media use under their grandparents’ watch, but also suggest effective strategies for its reduction. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","grandchildren; grandparents; interactive media; mediation; screen time; Young children",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC

However, information exchange falls short as an explanation for child media practices like those described in Gaming Disorder, recently classified as a disease by the World Health Organization. Why have devices become so enmeshed in children’s lives, both inside and outside the home? Using research on the media practices of children with disabilities like autism and ADHD as a template, this commentary calls for an ecological reconceptualization of media devices as “care structures” that provide not just children with disabilities, but all children, with largely unrecognized accommodations beyond the standard informational, emotional, and relational gratifications specified in traditional media gratifications research. Understanding “media curb cuts” and other unacknowledged accommodations will be essential for making sense of children’s attachments to media and finding solutions for family conflict associated with child media use. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","accommodation; children; conflict; disability; gratifications; Media",,,,,,,"Kristen Harrison (Ph.D., University of Wisconsin-Madison) has been studying children and media since 1992.

Previous research has shown that the use of touchscreen devices can benefit pre-schoolers’ learning, especially within school and home settings. However, little is known about the broader sociocultural environment within which such technology adoption by families with pre-schoolers takes place, especially in the Global South. Guided by Bronfenbrenner’s ecology of human development, this research investigates the ecology of tablet use and early childhood learning by pre-schoolers in Vietnam through an ethnographic investigation of 42 mother-child dyads. We found that Vietnamese pre-schoolers’ tablet use for the purpose of early childhood learning was initiated, sustained or even enforced by their parents. Vietnamese mothers strongly regard tablets as learning tools that give their children a distinct edge in educational achievement. However, such enthusiastic appropriation of the tablets was not matched by the mothers’ concomitant understanding of the benefits and risks of touchscreen devices for children, nor the availability of social scaffolding structures for the parents. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","early childhood learning; media ecology; Pre-schoolers; tablet devices; touchscreen devices; Vietnam",,,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS

We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children’s media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children’s narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children’s exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","childhood studies; ethnographic immersion; Gujarat; Media cultures; rural children",,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D., (1995) An ecology of communication: Cultural formats of control, , New York, NY: Aldine de Gruyter; Arora, P., Instant-messaging Shiva, flying taxis, Bil Klinton and more: Children’s narratives from rural India (2008) International Journal of Cultural Studies, 11 (1), pp. 669-686; Avila-Saavedra, G., Neither here nor there: Consumption of US media among pre-adolescent girls in Ecuador (2013) Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture, 4 (3), pp. 255-269; Banaji, S., Disempowering by assumption: Digital natives and EU civic web project (2011) Deconstructing digital natives: Young people, technology, and the new literacies, pp. 49-66. , Thomas M., (ed), New York, NY: Routledge,.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 22 preschoolers from low-income families and their primary caregivers. Children demonstrated substantively significant gains in preliteracy and emergent math skills after 3 months of educational app use at home, compared with a control group who used wholesome entertainment apps over the same period. Parent-rated academic interest also significantly increased for the experimental group compared to the control group. The educational apps were well-received and used as directed. Apps were most often used with a parent or sibling. Given the prevalence of mobile devices–even in the lowest income communities–and the low cost of apps, educational apps may be a promising avenue of intervention to address early achievement gaps. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","early intervention; educational apps; low income; School readiness",,,,,,"University of Massachusetts Amherst

As media and fictional portrayals of suicide are known to influence suicidal behaviors, professional organizations expressed concern that the show would lead to a spike in suicidality among its viewers. We wished to understand the context to any documented references to 13 Reasons Why among pediatric patients in a large healthcare system. We searched all clinical documentation for patients under 18 for the terms “13 (or Thirteen) Reasons Why” for the six months surroundings the show’s release, recording demographics, location, and clinical context for each reference. This search yielded 63 separate clinical notes of 31 unique patients where 13 Reasons Why was explicitly documented. All but one reference took place during an encounter related primarily to the patient’s mental health, with most patients making these references during an encounter related to suicide (71%; 22). The most common context of the reference (55%; 17) was the patient or guardian reporting that the show contributed to their worsening mental health symptoms.

Targeted marketing raises further public health concerns as Black and Latino youth are also exposed to greater amounts of unhealthy food marketing in the media and their communities. However, little is known about Black and Latino adolescents’ attitudes toward brands and marketing that target them directly. Focus groups with Black and Latino adolescents (N= 51) explored their attitudes toward targeted and non-targeted brands of food, beverages, and restaurants. Pile sorting activities using cards printed with targeted and non-targeted brand logos were used as an elicitation technique. Overall, participants indicated more positive attitudes about the targeted brands discussed in the focus groups than the non-targeted brands, and participants often described targeted brands as being for someone most like them. Some participants expressed appreciation for marketing that recognized “someone like them” as potential consumers, while others raised ethical issues regarding targeting of unhealthy foods. Participants’ strong affinity for targeted brands, and ambivalent attitudes about targeted marketing of unhealthy products, highlight an opportunity to increase awareness of food marketing targeting communities of color and address targeted marketing through countermarketing and grassroots advocacy campaigns. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; consumer perceptions and attitudes; Food and beverage marketing; racial/ethnic minorities; social marketing campaigns; targeted marketing",,,,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF: 73446","This work was supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [73446].

Network, style, and content ratings were collected for 88 shows using a combination of Common Sense Media and laboratory ratings applied to two randomly-selected episodes of each show. Overall, currently popular children’s television shows were most often animated and contained little violent, prosocial, or educational content, but a great deal of fantastical content. Interrelations among variables were also examined. Shows with fantastical events were both more violent and more prosocial than shows without, and shows with anthropomorphism were more prosocial than shows without. The network on which a show aired predicted violent, prosocial, and educational content, but not fantastical content. Children’s television today is not as violent as might be believed, but nor is it particularly prosocial or educational. It is highly fantastical.

However, little is known about the content of educational media, particularly in relation to vocabulary instruction. Since vocabulary is an important predictor of later reading comprehension, it warrants a thorough investigation on how it is taught in educational media. This study presents a content analysis of vocabulary instruction in a weighted sample of all educational programs on the media marketplace for young children. We examine the time spent on vocabulary in educational media, the words selected, and the screen-based pedagogical supports (SBPS) that facilitate vocabulary learning in videos. We found that few sophisticated words were selected for instruction, and identified 11 SBPSs used during vocabulary instruction in our weighted sample. These findings provide a more holistic understanding of the content of vocabulary instruction in educational media for young children. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","content analysis; early childhood education; early literacy; educational media; Vocabulary",,,,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, IES: R305A150143","This work was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences [R305A150143].",,"Beck, I., McKeown, M., Increasing young low income children’s oral vocabulary repertoires through rich and focused instruction (2007) The Elementary School Journal, 107 (3), pp. 251-271; Beck, I., McKeown, M., Kucan, L., (2002) Bringing words to life, , New York: Guilford; Beck, I.L., McKeown, M.G., Teaching vocabulary: Making the instruction fit the goal (1985) Educational Perspectives, 23 (1), pp. 11-15; Biemiller, A., Vocabulary development and instruction: A prerequisite for school learning (2006) Handbook of early literacy research, 2, pp. 41-51. , Dickinson D., Neuman S.B., (eds), New York, NY: Guilford Press,.

The study’s underlying assumption is that understanding how young children acquire political knowledge is important because occurrences during early childhood have a major impact on socialization. The research considers the methodological difficulties involved in working with this age group and the perspectives associated with cultural structuring, according to which children are apolitical and therefore lack political knowledge or insights. The research examines political knowledge in the context of Israeli elections for the parliament and the prime minister and was conducted around a month prior to the elections. The results reveal that the dominant socialization agents contributing to children’s political knowledge are parents, television and school. In addition, the study found that a combination of a number of socialization agents yields increased political knowledge. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","elections; elementary school children; media; Political knowledge; political socialization agents",,,,,,,,,"Allen, G.L., The growth of children’s political knowledge during an election year (1994) Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 40 (3), pp. 356-377; Alon-Tirosh, M., Lemish, D., “If I was making news”: What do children want from news?

It is committed to publishing research from underrepresented countries. Despite this commitment, however, much of what is published in JOCAM, as well as in other youth-focused journals, draws its samples from so-called WEIRD settings (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). Moreover, research on children, adolescents and media (CAM) often fails to recognize children who are at the margins of society because they are poor, housing insecure, or living with disability. In this commentary we examine the invisible children of CAM research and explore why their experiences remain largely unexamined. We highlight the barriers to conducting research with these particularly vulnerable populations, and we suggest opportunities for reducing such barriers. We conclude by arguing that it is our moral and ethical duty to do our best to represent the role of media within the diverse experiences of childhood. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children and media; institutional review board; vulnerable population; WEIRD samples",,,,,,,,,"Alper, M., (2017) Giving voice: Mobile communication, disability, and inequality, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

We explore how caregivers perceive and mediate children’s books, with an emphasis on those portraying popular media characters, through two qualitative studies. Through non-participant observation at the public library, we capture how caregivers and children negotiate and choose books. While a few caregivers employed restrictive mediation, most valued children’s book choices, irrespective of content. Our interview study of parents largely supports the findings of our observation study. Some parents revealed their concerns about age-inappropriate or problematic characters and passively avoided the books with those characters. However, parents primarily respected their children’s book preferences. The ways in which caregivers shape their children’s media and book reading are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children’s books; interviews; media characters; non-participant observation; parental mediation; reading",,,,,,,"This research was supported by Institute of Communications Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",,"Anderson, D.A., Hamilton, M., Gender role stereotyping of parents in children’s picture books: The invisible father (2005) Sex Roles, 52 (3-4), pp. 145-151; Anderson, D.R., Bryant, J., Wilder, A., Santomero, A., Williams, M., Crawley, A.M., Researching Blue’s Clues: Viewing behavior and impact (2000) Media Psychology, 2 (2), pp. 179-194; Atkinson, L., Nelson, M.R., Rademacher, M.A., A humanistic approach to understanding child consumer socialization in US homes (2015) Journal of Children and Media, 9 (1), pp. 95-112; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory (1989) Annals of child development (Vol.6), pp. 1-60. , Vasta R., (ed), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press,.

Research affirms preschool-aged children can learn content from media when they attend to it, however less is known about how specific screen-based pedagogical supports (SBPS) might draw children’s attention. Using eye-tracking methodology, the current study examines specific SBPSs that engage children’s attention. The sample consisted of 106 3- to 5-year-olds from a poverty-impacted neighborhood. Participants viewed 12 video clips of Sesame Street that used four different SBPSs to support vocabulary: visual effects, visual + sound effects, explicit definitions, and explicit definitions + repetitions. Results indicated that children attended significantly more to the SBPSs with definitions. Findings also revealed differences in screen composition. Children attended more to people than objects, and attended more to on-screen conversations than conversations cut between screens. This study demonstrates the importance for educational media to use appropriate SBPSs and on-screen compositions to engage children. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attention; children; eye-tracking; media; television; Video",,,,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, IES: R305A150143","This work was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences [R305A150143].",,"Council on communications and media: Media and young minds (2016) Pediatrics, 138, p. 5; Anderson, D.R., Kirkorian, H.L., Media and cognitive development (2015) Handbook of child psychology and developmental science, 7th edition, Vol. 2: Cognitive processes, pp. 949-994. , Lerner R.M., (ed), Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, &,.

Recent research has shown that anthropomorphic portrayals of animals in books lead children to think anthropomorphically about real animals. Here we asked whether this is also the case for an inanimate object. Specifically, does exposure to an anthropomorphized train, as compared to a real train, increase children’s tendency to make anthropomorphic attributions to real trains? We also investigated whether this effect with books extends to another common medium of presentation: video. Chinese preschoolers (n = 258) ages 4–6 were randomly assigned to watch a video or listen to a book about either a real or an anthropomorphized train. Before and after this exposure, children completed a modified Anthropomorphism Questionnaire–Child Form (IDAQ-CF), which included questions about trains. Children who were exposed to the anthropomorphic book significantly increased in their tendency to view real trains as having human-like qualities, as compared to control children who had no exposure. Video exposure had no effect on the anthropomorphism of trains. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anthropomorphism; book; media exposure; preschoolers; thinking; train; video",,,,,,"John Templeton Foundation, JTF: 56225

This research brief investigated how familial correlates within a household context, such as television use, BMI, and feeding practices, are related to child physical activity (CPA). Parents of preschoolers (N = 278, average age 40–76 months) completed survey measures of CPA, child and parent television use, BMI (height and weight), child control of feeding practices, and parental modeling of child feeding practices. From this sample, parents also had their preschoolers’ BMI percentiles calculated by a team of researchers, resulting in 247 complete parent-child pairs. Separate regression analyses revealed that child weekly television use and parent weekly television use predicted less CPA; however, when simultaneously controlling for child and parental correlates, only parent weekly television use predicted less CPA. Post-hoc analyses revealed an interaction between parent and child television use, such that parent-child pairs who reported higher weekly TV use reported less frequent CPA than parent-child pairs who reported lower weekly TV use.

The focus of the analysis is on children’s questions regarding the on-going program and parents’ responses to children’s questions. The data consist of 122 questions in 28 television-viewing episodes in 16 Finnish families. Through questions, children treat parents as more knowledgeable regarding media portrayals but asking questions also gives children interactional power to steer the conversation and assess the information their parents provide. In their responses, the parents take the knowing position and explain media content and its relation to the real world. In the process, norms and values are mediated. We distinguish three orientations in parents’ responses: mediating television content, selecting the focus of response and attending to emotional cues. The paper will discuss the relationship of these activities to a larger social psychological phenomenon of parental mediation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Family interaction; media; parental mediation; parent–child interaction; television",,,,,,"Academy of Finland: 138209","This work was supported by the Academy of Finland [138209].",,"Antaki, C., Six kinds of applied conversation analysis (2011) Applied conversation analysis: Intervention and change in institutional talk, pp. 1-14. , Antaki C., (ed), London: Palgrave Macmillan,.

This influence is particularly problematic among high-reactance teens (that is, those with a predisposition to resist adult control). This study documents one strategy parents can use to counteract TV influences: parental presence during the TV viewing experience (co-viewing). Survey data were collected from a nationally representative sample of parents and their children aged 13–17 (N = 396). Parents reported how they monitored their children’s TV consumption, and adolescents completed a survey in which they reported the amount of TV they watch, completed a trait reactance scale and indicated their views and intentions regarding drinking. Results revealed that the influence of TV viewing on adolescents’ drinking intentions was lower for teens high in trait reactance who grew up with parents who co-view television with them. This did not occur when parents adopted instructive or restrictive communication strategies. The parental monitoring strategy of co-viewing thus emerges as a promising protective approach for a population that has traditionally been considered vulnerable (i.e., high reactance teens). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescence; alcohol; media monitoring; Parenting; personality traits; reactance; television",,,,,,,,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications; Policy statement.

In 2014, with the participation of 42 Portuguese children in six focus groups, the research concluded that the nature of children’s involvement with the news is contextualised within the following variables: gender; preferences; life experiences; skills to process issues; forms of exposure and media coverage of events; and family mediation. The data reveal that children frequently watch the news and get involved and excited about these topics. But, the results also reveal that children may feel disturbed when viewing certain problematic events to which they direct their attention mainly as a result of permanent media coverage of such events via shocking images. The latter phenomenon arises even more frequently during moments of crisis and terrorism, imposing the need to focus on media literacy. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children; Current events; Impact; Media; Media literacy",,,,,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, FCT: SFRH/ BD/80918/2011

Results showed that when discussing cyberbullying, adolescents focused on how we relate to one another when cyberbullying occurs and parents focused on the repercussions of cyberbullying. Adolescents and parents agreed that parents needed to do a better job of trying to understand how their adolescents engage with others on social media in order to become effective allies in addressing this issue.

Furthermore, it offers insights into both influencing factors barely discussed in previous research and the underlying effect mechanisms. A field experiment was performed in natural viewing and shopping scenarios. For the first time, children aged 3 to 5 were incorporated. Results of multilevel and logistic regression moderation and mediation analyses show that the risk of selecting a placed product was more than nine times higher in the treatment group than in the control group, which was moderated by age: younger children were more likely to select the advertised products. Neither gender nor consumption habits affected the correlation. The time span between stimulus and choice tended to have an influence. Findings support the assumption of implicit persuasion processes via evaluative conditioning and, partially, mere-exposure-effects. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Actual shopping scenario; Advertising literacy; Behavioral effects; Children; Embedded advertising; Evaluative conditioning; Implicit persuasion; Product placement; Public health; Real-life study",,,,,,"Ãsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÃAW","This work was supported by the Austrian Academy of Sciences and ORF Enterprise GmbH & Co KG.",,"An, S., Jin, H.S., Park, E.H., Children’s advertising literacy for advergames: Perception of the game as advertising (2014) International Journal of Advertising, 43, pp. 63-72; Arendt, F., Naderer, B., Abdollahi, M., Mittelberger, A., Surzhyk, O., Zhou, L., Television commercials and fading behavioral brand choice effects in Austrian children (2015) Journal of Children and Media, 9, pp. 435-452; Auty, S., Lewis, C., Exploring children’s choice: The reminder effect of product placement (2004) Psychology & Marketing, 21, pp. 697-713; Wedge, C., (2013) Epic.

The emergence of Crinkling News, the only national newspaper specifically produced for young Australians, drew widespread attention before it closed after 20 months of publication in 2018. With the Australian media in a state of flux, the initial success of this newspaper highlighted the importance of introducing children to media literacy. This paper explores the characteristics of the presentation of news for children through the pages of Crinkling News. Utilising news values, this study also investigates the selection of angles and how stories and information are packaged for young audiences. It will examine how traditional content is mixed with user-generated contributions. Drawing on a content analysis of 12 months of issues, the paper outlines the type of coverage and story topics used to engage children in journalism. By providing key insights into generational access to news, this paper develops further understanding into children’s media literacy and provides recommendations for future scholarship. It also highlights the importance of enabling children’s participation in news as part of the critical public sphere. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; Children’s media; Children’s newspapers; Crinkling News; Journalism; Media literacy",,,,,,,,,"Alon-Tirosh, M., Children and news: Opinions of children’s news program creators in Israel (2017) Journal of Children & Media, 11 (2), pp. 132-146; Alon-Tirosh, M., Lemish, D., If I was making the news”: What do children want from news.

In this article, we aim to deepen the understanding of how children make sense of YouTubers as a phenomenon, and the role of microcelebrities in children’s everyday life. The study is based on group interviews with 9-and 12-year-old Swedish children, and pays specific attention to how they make sense of the video “♥Pin up tutorial (JFR.SE)♥,” produced by the YouTuber Misslisibell. In the analysis, we explore how the children construct and negotiate Misslisibell as celebrity, celebrity endorser, and young girl. Particularly salient were children’s negotiations around the YouTuber’s celebrity status, children’s normative discussions around Misslisibell’s YouTube practices related to her young age, and children’s various interpretations of the video as advertising, “tips,” and as a space for learning. These multifaceted and sometimes contra-dictive ways of making sense show the multiplicity of meanings YouTubers have for children. © 2018 The Author(s).","Advertising; Celebrity; Celebrity endorsement; Meaning making; Microcelebrity; Social media; Sponsoring; YouTube; YouTubers",,,,,,,,,"Allen, K., Harvey, L., Mendick, H., ‘Justin Bieber sounds girlie’: Young people’s celebrity talk and contemporary masculinities (2015) Sociological Research Online, 20 (3), pp. 1-15; Allen, K., Mendick, H., Young people’s uses of celebrity: Class, gender and ‘improper’ celebrity (2013) Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education, 34 (1), pp. 77-93; Barker, M., Holmes, S., Ralph, S., Editorial: Audiences for stardom and celebrity (2015) Celebrity Studies, 6 (1), pp. 1-5; Bazeley, P., (2013) Qualitative Data Analysis: Practical Strategies, , London: Sage; Bergkvist, L., Zhou, K.Q., Celebrity endorsements: A literature review and research agenda (2016) International Journal of Advertising, 35 (4), pp. 642-663; Berryman, R., Kavka, M., ‘I guess a lot of people see me as a big sister or a friend’: The role of intimacy in the celebrification of beauty vloggers (2017) Journal of Gender Studies, 26 (3), pp. 307-320; Brembeck, H., Johansson, B., Kampmann, J., (2004) Beyond the Competent Child: Exploring Contemporary Childhoods in the Nordic Welfare Societies, , Frederiksberg: Roskilde University Press; Buckingham, D., (1993) Children Talking Television: The Making of Television Literacy, , London: Falmer; Buckingham, D., (2008) The International Handbook of Children, Media and Culture, pp. 219-236. , Children and media: A cultural studies approach.

The study, built upon past literature in gaze theory, revealed six distinct interaction themes between female and male characters. Findings included that female characters were often emotionally supportive of male characters, were lusted after by male characters, were romantically aggressive towards male characters, and were paired with male characters at the conclusion of each film. Changes in themes throughout the trilogy and the presence of these themes in children’s media, and in relation to existing theory, are also discussed. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children’s media; Gendered interaction themes; Male gaze; Pixar; Symbolic annihilation; Toy Story",,,,,,,,,"Altheide, D.L., (1996) Qualitative Media Analysis, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage; Aubrey, J.S., Effects of sexually objectifying media on self-objectification and body surveillance in undergraduates: Results of a 2-year panel study (2006) Journal of Communication, 56 (2), pp. 366-386; Babbie, E., (1992) The Practice of Social Research, , New York: Macmillan; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3 (3), pp. 265-299; Bazzini, D.G., McIntosh, W., Smith, S., Cook, S., Harris, C., The aging woman in popular film: Underrepresented, unattractive, unfriendly, and unintelligent (1997) Sex Roles, 36 (7-8), pp. 531-543; Behm-Morawitz, E., Hoffswell, J., Chen, S.-W., The virtual threat effect: A test of competing explanations for the effects of racial stereotyping in video games on players’ cognitions (2016) Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, 19 (5), pp. 308-313; Birthisel, J., How body, heterosexuality and patriarchal entanglements mark non-human characters as male in CGI-animated children’s films (2014) Journal of Children and Media, 8 (4), pp. 336-352; Bussey, K., Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation (1999) Psychological Review, 106 (4), pp. 676-713; Columpar, C., The gaze as theoretical touchstone: The intersection of film studies, feminist theory (2002) And Postcolonial Theory.

The study further explored how these parent–child interactions compared to those around shared reading and joint play with a math toy, and examined how the quality of parental behaviors (warmth, playfulness, parent engagement, and autonomy support) related to child engagement and affect during the interactions. Children took more of a lead role during app interactions compared to shared reading and math toy play. Higher quality parenting behaviors were related to higher child engagement and less negative affect during the app interactions and to child engagement and positive affect during the shared reading and math toy interactions.

Drawing on the literature on the role of emotion in responding to fiction, this article argues that while all fantastic fiction aspires within its own framework to be realistic in various ways, it is in the bringing together of the fictive and the real, the everyday and the exceptional into a continuum which gives fiction its real meaning in the lives of young people. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescents; audience study; Disney; emotions; fairy tale; fantasy; Harry Potter; identification; Pottermania; realism",,,,,,,"Ranjana Das is a senior lecturer at the University of Surrey where her current work focuses on parenthood, new technologies and well-being.

Prior research suggests there are also differential associations in how exposure to media content affects adolescent behavior. This study examines the demographic representation of main characters and health risk behaviors (i.e., sex, alcohol use, violence, bullying, and their combinations) portrayed in television content popular with Black and non-Black adolescents. A content analysis of television show characters (n = 377) from the 2014–2015 season was conducted on shows popular with 14–17-year old adolescent audiences in the United States. Group popularity was determined by Nielsen ratings segmented by Black and non-Black (primarily White) adolescents. Results suggest that character representation varies by whether shows were popular with Blacks or others, and that risk portrayals are common in all popular content with few group differences. Implications for adolescent behavior are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescents; alcohol; content analysis; race differences; risk behavior; sex; television; violence",,,,,,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: 1R21HD079615","This work was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) under Grant Number [1R21HD079615].

A survey conducted with parents of young smartphone users aged 10–17 in the United States (N = 304) reveals that parents who feel confident about their own smartphone skills view themselves as good parents and believe that they have control over their parental mediation practices and are more likely to engage in parental mediation of children’s smartphone use. The findings also indicate that when parents are less confident about their smartphone skills, those with higher parenting competencies are more likely to engage in discussion-based active mediation than those with lower parenting competencies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children’s smartphone use; parental media competency; Parental mediation; parental mediation self-efficacy; parenting self-efficacy",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The Exercise of Self-control, , New York: Freeman; Bandura, A., Schunk, D.H., Cultivating competence, self-efficacy, and intrinsic interest through proximal self-motivation (1981) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41, pp. 586-596; Cantor, J., Wilson, B.J., Media and violence: Intervention strategies for reducing aggression (2003) Media Psychology, 5, pp. 363-403; Center, P.R., (2015) Teens, social media & technology overview 2015, , http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2015/04/PI_TeensandTech_Update2015_0409151.pdf, 6April, 2016, Retrieved from; Cho, C.-H., Cheon, H.J., Children’s exposure to negative internet content: Effects of family context (2005) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 49 (4), pp. 488-509; Clark, L.S., Parental mediation theory for the digital age (2011) Communication Theory, 21 (4), pp. 323-343; Evans, J.D., (1996) Straightforward Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, , Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole Publishing; (2014) Parenting in the Digital Age, , https://www.fosi.org/policy-research/parenting-digital-age/, 6April, 2016, Retrieved from; Fujioka, Y., Austin, E.W., The implications of vantage point in parental mediation of television and child’s attitudes toward drinking alcohol (2003) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 47 (3), pp. 418-434; Glatz, T., Buchanan, C.M., Over-time associations among parental self-efficacy, promotive parenting practices, and adolescents externalizing behaviors (2015) Journal of Family Psychology, 29 (3), pp. 427-437; Graf, F., Grumm, M., Hein, S., Fingerle, M., Improving parental competencies: Subjectively perceived usefulness of a parent training matters (2014) Journal of Family Studies, 23, pp. 20-28; Holloway, S., Campbell, E.J., Nagase, A., Kim, S., Suzuki, S., Wang, Q., Baak, S.Y., Parenting self-efficacy and parental involvement: Mediators or moderators between socioeconomic status and children’s academic competence in Japan and Korea?

Here, we compared the immediate effects of physical and touchscreen play on 2.5-year-olds’ cognitive flexibility, a key aspect of executive function. For nine minutes, toddlers engaged in touchscreen play or physical play; a third group drew and colored (control group). Next, a sorting task measured cognitive flexibility. The physical-play group outperformed the other two groups. Compared to the control group, toddlers’ cognitive flexibility benefited from physical play, whereas touchscreen play yielded no significant effect. Interestingly, toddlers who played the touchscreen game in a socially interactive way outperformed those who treated gaming as solitary play. Together, the results bear practical implications on whether and how to introduce young children to interactive technologies for play. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cognitive flexibility; individual differences; physical activity; social interaction; Toddlers and technology",,,,,,"University of California, Santa Cruz, UCSC

In this article, I explore how Norwegian parents of girls experienced the Disney tween shows, and tied in merchandise of Hannah Montana and High School Musical. As the parents interviewed reported feeling ambivalent and conflicted about the Disney shows, the article makes use of Bakhtin’s dialogism and domestication theory to explore this ambivalence. Employing the concept of voice from Bakhtin, the interview data suggest five voices the parents drew on–the educational voice, the voice of children’s autonomy, Disney as innocent and safe, the voice of caring consumption and the culture critical voice. The analysis focuses on how these voices operated, how they were expressed in the interviews, and what these different voices produced in terms of how Disney was included in the everyday home life. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bakhtin’s dialogism; Disney; domestication; moral economy; parents; Tweens",,,,,,,,,"Adler, P.A., Adler, P., (1998) Peer power: Preadolescent culture and indentity, , New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, &; Alvesson, M., Sköldberg, K., (2009) Reflexive methodology: New vistas for qualitative research, , London: Sage; Bakardjieva, M., Domestication running wild.

A total of 954 mothers of children between the ages of 5–12 from the United States and 437 from the Netherlands participated in the study. The results suggest that there are considerable differences in how children in these two countries are socialized as consumers and what parents report concerning their child’s consumer development and consumer behavior.

The current investigation has assessed how movies later nominated for or awarded the best movie of the year by US and British children were evaluated by the US, British and Australian film advisory boards, and the US media advocacy and education organization Common Sense Media (CSM). The findings indicate that the movies these two populations of children consider the year’s finest differ considerably, that the movies chosen are assigned to different age classifications, with each board using a different dominant combination of justifications to explain these age restrictions. CSM ratings reveal that British children prefer movies with positive messages, and their US peers prefer those infused with profanity, sex, and consumerism. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children; film advisory boards; film awards; media consumption; movies",,,,,,,,,"http://www.baftakids.org/, Retrieved December 20, 2017, from; (2014), http://www.bbfc.co.uk/what-classification/guidelines, December 21, 2017, from; Hura, L., Necromancy in the UK: Witchcraft and the occult in British horror (2002) British horror cinema, pp. 82-98. , Chibnall S., Petley J., (eds), London: Routledge,.

This is reflected in the lack of validated instruments to assess adolescents’ online prosocial behavior. To address this issue, we developed the Online Prosocial Behavior Scale (OPBS) to assess adolescents’ involvement in online prosocial behavior. Two subscales (performing and receiving online prosocial behavior) were constructed and their factor structure was evaluated and confirmed through parallel analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. The OPBS-subscales displayed good reliability and correlated positively with offline prosocial behavior and use of digital media, supporting the scale’s construct validity. Unexpectedly, the subscales also correlated positively with online antisocial behavior, which may be understood within the framework of the online disinhibition theory. The scale can be a useful tool for researchers and practitioners who need a global instrument to assess adolescents’ online prosocial behavior. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; antisocial behavior; measurement instrument; online behavior; Prosocial behavior; prosocialness; scale development; scale validation",,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO: FWO G.0335.14N","This research was supported by the Research Foundation Flanders [grant number FWO G.0335.14N].",,"Allen, J.P., Antonishak, J., Adolescent peer influences: Beyond the dark side (2008) Understanding peer influence in children and adolescents, pp. 141-160. , Prinstein M.J., Dodge K.A., (eds), New York, NY: Guilford Press, &,.

I used content analysis to describe the types of advertised food products, the persuasive techniques of the advertisements of these products, and the portrayals of eating behaviors on food advertising. Findings revealed that food promotion was more prominent in point-of-purchase advertising and less on television. The three most common advertised products were sweets, sugary drinks, and fast-food restaurants, and the persuasive techniques most commonly associated with food and beverage advertisements were appeals to the flavor/taste/smell/texture, nutritional quality, competitive/unique, and newness of the product; only one emotional appeal stood out in one medium: family bonding was frequent on television. This study is one of the few that have collectively surveyed food advertising that children and adolescents are likely to find in their multimedia environment. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; advertising; children; food; obesity; Peru",,,,,,,"This work was supported by the Instituto de Investigación Científica of Universidad de Lima.",,"Álvarez-Dongo, D., Sánchez-Abanto, J., Gómez-Guizado, G., Tarqui-Mamani, C., Overweight and obesity: Prevalence and determining social factors of overweight in the peruvian population (2009–2010) (2012) Revista Peruana de Medicina Experimental y Salud Pública, 29 (3), pp. 303-313. , http://www.scielo.org.pe/pdf/rins/v29n3/a03v29n3.pdf, –,.

A two-study design included concurrent data from 153 adolescents ages 13–17 (55.6% female), and retrospective data from 274 college students ages 18–22 (79.8% female). Across both samples, emotional involvement in a PSRR was related to more idealized romantic beliefs. The intensity of emotional involvement with the media figure during adolescence was associated with lower relationship satisfaction and less favorable perceptions of a current romantic partner in college students. However, there were no significant associations between physical attraction to the media figure and relationship outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; media effects; Parasocial relationships; romantic relationships",,,,,,,,,"Allen, L., Ingram, T., ‘Bieber Fever’: Girls, desire and the negotiation of girlhood sexualities (2015) Children, sexuality and sexualization, pp. 141-158. , Ringrose J., Renold E., Egan R.D., (eds), London: Pilgrave Macmillan, &,. In, (Eds; Arnett, J.J., Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties (2000) American Psychologist, 55 (5), p. 469; Braboy Jackson, P., Kleiner, S., Geist, C., Cebulko, K., Conventions of courtship: Gender and race differences in the significance of dating rituals (2011) Journal of Family Issues, 32 (5), pp. 629-652; Brown, J.D., Halpern, C.T., L’Engle, K.L., Mass media as a sexual super peer for early maturing girls (2005) Journal of Adolescent Health, 36 (5), pp. 420-427; Collins, W.A., More than myth: The developmental significance of romantic relationships during adolescence (2003) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 13 (1), pp. 1-24; Collins, W.A., Welsh, D.P., Furman, W., Adolescent romantic relationships (2009) Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 631-652; Driesmans, K., Vandenbosch, L., Eggermont, S., True love lasts forever: The influence of a popular teenage movie on Belgian girls’ romantic beliefs (2016) Journal of Children and Media, 10 (3), pp. 1-17; Dukes, R.L., Bisel, T.M., Borega, K.N., Lobato, E.A., Owens, M.D., Expressions of love, sex, and hurt in popular songs: a content analysis of all-time greatest hits (2003) The Social Science Journal, 40 (4), pp. 643-650; Edwards, R., Honeycutt, J.M., Zagacki, K.S., Sex differences in imagined interactions (1989) Sex Roles, 21 (3-4), pp. 263-272; Eyal, K., Dailey, R.M., Examining relational maintenance in parasocial relationships (2012) Mass Communication and Society, 15 (5), pp. 758-781; Feldman, S.S., Gowen, L.K., Fisher, L., Family relationships and gender as predictors of romantic intimacy in young adults: A longitudinal study (1998) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 8 (2), pp. 263-286; Fisher, H., (2006) The new psychology of love, pp. 87-115. , Sternberg R.J., Weis K., (eds), New Haven, CT: Yale University Press,.

The premise is that these literacy skills are mutually reinforcing and inseparable. The study uses a population of children aged three to four who attend a preschool that bases an entire program on digital photography for the purpose of encouraging multimodal literacy and the conscious integration of verbal and visual literacy. It is found that young children who study with and about digital photographs improve their ability to perceive details and broaden their linguistic parameters considerably, including vocabulary, use of complex sentences, asking questions, and telling stories about pictures. As for the acquisition of visual literacy skills, the findings show that this kind of learning encourages decision-making in choosing contents and designing photographs. It also encourages verbal reflection about self-taken pictures. The study demonstrates the need to apply an integrated approach to literacy and to make the requisite changes from early childhood on. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","early-childhood photography; multimodal literacy; photo-based curriculum; verbal literacy; Visual literacy",,,,,,,"This study was supported by the Mofet Institute.",,"Alloway, T.P., Williams, S., Jones, B., Cochrane, F., Exploring the impact of television watching on vocabulary skills in toddlers (2014) Early Childhood Education Journal, 42 (5), pp. 343-349; Avgerinou, M.D., Re-viewing visual literacy in the “Bain d’ Images” era (2009) TechTrend, 53 (2), pp. 28-34; Avgerinou, M.D., Pettersson, R., Toward a cohesive theory of visual literacy (2011) Journal of Visual Literacy, 30 (2), pp. 1-19; Britsch, S., Photo-booklets for English language learning: Incorporating visual communication into early childhood teacher preparation (2010) Early Childhood Education Journal, 38 (3), pp. 171-177; Byrnes, J., Wasik, B.A., Picture this: Using photography as a learning tool in early childhood classrooms (2009) Childhood Education, 85 (Summer), pp. 243-248; Curtiss, D., (2001) Introduction to visual literacy: A guide to the visual arts and communication, , Prentice Hall; Edwards, C.P., Willis, L.M., Integrating visual and verbal literacies in the early childhood classroom (2000) Early Childhood Education Journal, 27 (4), pp. 259-265; Einarsdottir, J., Playschool in pictures: Children’s photographs as a research method (2005) Early Child Development and Care, 175 (6), pp. 523-541; Einarsdottir, J., Children’s and parents’ perspectives on the purposes of playschool in Iceland (2008) International Journal of Educational Research, 47, pp. 283-291; Ewald, W., Lightfoot, A., (2001) I wanna take me a picture: Teaching photography and writing to children, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Technology and interactive media as tools in early childhood programs serving children from birth through age 8 (2012) A joint position statement of the National Association for the Education of Young Children and the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children’s Media at Saint Vincent College, , http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf, Retrieved from; Ganea, P.A., Pickard, M., DeLoache, J.S., Transfer between picture books and the real world by very young children (2008) Journal of Cognition and Development, 9, pp. 46-66; Good, L., (2008) Teaching and learning with digital photography: Tips and tools for early childhood classrooms, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press; Jewitt, C., (2008) The visual in learning and creativity: A review of the literature, , http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/wp-content/uploads/the-visual-in-learning-and-creativity-92.pdf, A report for Creative Partnerships Arts Council, London:.

In each of these stories, boys’ feminine-identified actions received explicit support by newscasters and guest experts. Simultaneously, newscaster banter reframed the approbation of gender-fluidity to a more traditional characterization of gender as an immutable binary construct. The acceptance of gender-fluid behavior was attenuated by four discursive frames: the avowal of gender-fluid expression as acceptable only when child’s play, the presentation of boys’ mothers as supporting the violation of social norms, the positioning of parental acceptance as an act of reluctant resignation, and the assertion of male news reporters’ traditional masculinity and heterosexuality.

Four competing messages emerged: (1) Innocuity: Is sexting a harmless or harmful activity?; (2) Comparability: Were teenagers in the past the same or different than current teenagers?; (3) Criminality: Is teenage sexting a criminal offense or a legal activity?; and (4) Sexuality: Is teenage sexting sexual exploration or sexual exploitation? The online comments indicated an overall struggle between two different discursive constructions of sexting: A discourse of normal connection and a discourse of aberrant exposure.

We examined whether live co-viewer behavior (responsive or unresponsive), video chat partner’s eye gaze (aligned or misaligned), and object similarity (similar or dissimilar) impacted 24- to 30-month-old children’s responsiveness to (and short-term learning from) video chat. Co-viewer behavior was the primary factor influencing children’s responsiveness and learning; the on-screen Partner’s eye gaze was only influential in the presence of a responsive co-viewer; and object similarity did not impact the outcomes measured. Co-viewing provides essential support for children to respond to and learn from video chat interactions because it demonstrates the relevance and usefulness of the on-screen information.

While there is a link between sexualizing content and adverse outcomes such as self-objectification and body dissatisfaction, an interest in sexual media content is a normal part of healthy sexual development during the preteen years. Hence, research is needed that examines the variety in preteens’ sexual media diet thereby addressing the subtleties involved in sexualizing media. To what extent do sexual content, appearance-related content, sexual objectification, and objectification occur in Flemish preteens’ favorite TV shows? And, how are these different types of content related to gender roles? Seeking to address these questions, this article reports on a quantitative content analysis of 24 episodes from five TV shows popular among Flemish preteens. Drawing on a sample of 465 scenes, results demonstrated that one in five scenes contained sexual behavior, and one in ten contained sexual objectification. Male characters were sexually objectified as often as female characters. Women were more often judged for their appearance, but were also more often shown treating others as objects in a non-sexual way. Results are discussed in light of objectification and social cognitive theory, culminating in suggestions for future research and implications for parents. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Content analysis; Flemish; objectification; pre-adolescence; sexual objectification; sexualization; television",,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO","This study has been conducted within a four year project funded by Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [nr.

Data collected from 873 adolescents in the United States were examined in an ordered logistic regression model containing demographic variables; attitudes; self-efficacy; parent and peer normative beliefs; and media message processing variables. The analyses revealed that media message processing variables have a unique inﬂuence on adolescent sexual intentions above and beyond the inﬂuence of all the other predictors. Specifically, higher levels of perceived realism of, perceived similarity to, and identification with media messages were related to higher levels of adolescent sexual intent. These findings support the relevance of logical processing of media messages for adolescent intentions for sexual activity and suggest that this may be a possible cognitive mechanism to address in media literacy education programs focusing on promoting healthy decision-making. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents; Media; media influence; message interpretation processing; sexual intentions",,,,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: R44HD061193","This work was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [grant number R44HD061193].

Given that television is a powerful socializing agent, this study seeks to identify how gender is being represented in it using content analysis. The gender and role of 826 major characters across 89 programmes, which were telecast on 11 channels during the evenings, was analysed. The results show that 91.01% of all the programmes were animated. There was a gender bias in the programme titles, as the majority contained only male or gender-neutral names. Males (74.94%) outnumber females (25.06%) across all channels, irrespective of their target audience. More males than females were cast in all the character roles except in the role of the protagonist’s family member, where both genders were cast equally. The underrepresentation of females in some character roles also veered towards 100% on certain channels. Overall, most programmes seem oriented towards boys than girls. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Character roles; children; gender; India; kid’s genre; programming; stereotypes; television",,,,,,,"This work was supported by University Grants Commission of the Government of India under their Senior Research Fellowship Scheme.",,"Agrawal, B.C., (1999) Children’s television in India: A situational analysis, , New Delhi: Concept Publishing Company; Ahluwalia, A.K., Singh, R., TV viewing habits amongst urban children (2011) IUP Journal of Marketing Management, 10 (1), p. 45; Ahmed, S., Wahab, J.A., Animation and socialization process: Gender role portrayal on Cartoon Network (2014) Asian Social Science, 10 (3), p. 44; Al-Mahadin, S., Gender representations and stereotypes in cartoons: A Jordanian case study (2003) Feminist Media Studies, 3 (2), pp. 131-151; (2015) Gender identity development in children, , https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx, November 21) Retrieved March 09, 2017, from; Aubrey, J.S., Harrison, K., The gender-role content of children’s favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions (2004) Media Psychology, 6 (2), pp. 111-146; Baker, K., Raney, A.A., Equally super?: Gender-role stereotyping of superheroes in children’s animated programs (2007) Mass Communication & Society, 10 (1), pp. 25-41; Balasubramanian, D., (2015) Competition & fragmentation define kids’ genre in the South, , http://www.exchange4media.com/tv/competition–fragmentation-define-kids’-genre-in-the-south-_58672.html, January 3) Retrieved October 01, 2016, from; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (1994) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 61-90. , Bryant J., Zillmann D., (eds), Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,.

At the institutional level, this kind of office might be appealing because revenue for research-based apps would stay “in-house.”For researchers, in-person meetings would be more feasible and competing demands from external clients would be minimized, making development more efficient. These positions could be partially or fully funded by allocating grant funding from researchers who use the service. For example, at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, researchers can partner with staff at the Teaching and Research Application Development office to create technology for projects. Finally, institutions could hire staff to establish partnerships with external developers and facilitate the process across departments. Some universities already have these services available, so check whether such local support exists at your institution before launching with an external developer.","This work was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences [grant number #R305B130012] awarded to Golinkoff (with N.

Previous research, mainly conducted in developed countries, suggests that marketing and media exposure is associated with unhealthy eating behaviors. This cross-sectional study was done with 2422 children, mean age 5.5 years, SD =.5, from six low- and middle-income counties (LMICs) (Brazil, China, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Russia). The analyses investigated media exposure, logo recognition, and preferences for international foods and beverages, such as globally distributed items like McDonald’s hamburgers and Coca-Cola soft drinks. Overall and in each country, path analysis models showed that media exposure and logo recognition directly and indirectly predicted the selection of international foods and beverages, controlling for child’s sex, age, home location, and parental education. Public health and communication experts must continue to investigate and understand these relationships, so as to inform regulations around food and beverage marketing. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","branding; Brazil; China; India; marketing; Media receptivity; Nigeria; Pakistan; Russia; television",,,,,,,,,"Alhéritière, A., Montois, S., Galinski, M., Tazarourte, K., Lapostolle, F., Worldwide relation between the number of McDonald’s restaurants and the prevalence of obesity (2013) Journal of Internal Medicine, 274, pp. 610-611; Arredondo, E., Castaneda, D., Elder, J.P., Slymen, D., Dozier, D., Brand name logo recognition of fast food and healthy food among children (2009) Journal of Community Health, 34 (1), pp. 73-78; Atkin, A.J., Sharp, S.J., Corder, K., van Sluijs, E.M.F., Prevalence and correlates of screen time in youth: An international perspective (2014) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 47, pp. 803-807; Baker, P., Friel, S., Food systems transformations, ultra-processed food markets and the nutrition transition in Asia (2016) Globalization and Health, 12, p. 80; Basu, S., McKee, M., Galea, G., Stuckler, D., Relationship of soft drink consumption to global overweight, obesity, and diabetes: A cross-national analysis of 75 countries (2013) American Journal of Public Health, 103, pp. 2071-2077; Batada, A., Borzekowski, D., SNAP!

This experiment involved 113 Dutch children (M = 9.03; SD =.738) and their friends. Children in the experimental condition were exposed to a Disney clip in which the main character helped a friend, while children in the control condition watched a clip without helping behavior. Afterward, children’s helping behavior toward their friends was assessed during a puzzle challenge. A regression analysis revealed that children exposed to the helping Disney character were more likely to help their friends than children who did not watch this. The findings indicate a short-term effect of watching a helping Disney animated character on children’s helping behavior. © 2017 The Author(s).

Nutritious foods were portrayed more frequently than non-nutritious foods, and the outcomes of consuming food were mostly neutral, followed by positive, and then negative outcomes. Attractive characters most frequently experienced positive outcomes for consuming nutritious foods, whereas average-looking characters most frequently experienced negative outcomes for consuming nutritious food. Significant two-way interactions were found for nutritional quality with both food purpose and food occasion. Results are discussed in light of the healthful messages portrayed on tween television and the potential for modeling effects among tweens. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children and youth; Content analysis; food; global obesity; nutritional literacy; obesity; social cognitive theory; television and tweens; television viewers—health; television—psychological effects",,,,,,,,,"Aubrey, J.S., Frisby, C.M., Sexual objectification in music videos: A content analysis comparing gender and genre (2011) Mass Communication & Society, 14 (4), pp. 475-501; Avery, R.J., Mathios, A., Shanahan, J., Bisogni, C., Food and nutrition messages communicated through prime-time television (1997) Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 16 (2), pp. 217-227; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall Inc; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2009) Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 94-124. , Bryant J., Oliver M.B., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge,.

Research shows that parent–child interactions about media–parental mediation–can alter children’s responses to media exposure. Therefore, this study explored the relation between US parents’ perceptions of relational aggression in the media, parental mediation, and the responses of their pre-adolescent and adolescent children to relational aggression exposure. Results revealed that parents’ attitudes toward and perceptions of the amount of relational aggression on television were associated with parental mediation efforts. Parental mediation was positively associated with relational aggression among girls. Findings suggest that parental mediation may be related to an increase in relational aggression among pre-teen and teenage girls. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children; media effects; Parental mediation; relational aggression; television",,,,,,,,,"An, S.-K., Lee, D., An integrated model of parental mediation: The effect of family communication on children’s perception of television reality and negative viewing effects (2010) Asian Journal of Communication, 20, pp. 389-403; Archer, J., Coyne, S.M., An integrated review of indirect, relational, and social aggression (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 9, pp. 212-230; Bocking, S., Bocking, T., Parental mediation of television: Test of a German-speaking scale and findings on the impact of parental attitudes, sociodemographic and family factors in German-speaking Switzerland (2009) Journal of Children and Media, 3, pp. 286-302; Bowie, B.H., Relational aggression, gender, and the developmental process (2007) Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing, 20, pp. 107-115; Buijzen, M., Reducing children’s susceptibility to commercials: Mechanisms of factual and evaluative advertising interventions (2007) Media Psychology, 9, pp. 411-430; Chakroff, J., Nathanson, A., Parent and school interventions: Mediation and media literacy (2011) The handbook of children, media, and development, pp. 552-576. , Calvert S.L., Wilson B.J., (eds), West Sussex: Blackwell Publishing, &,.

Using questionnaire and focus-group discussion as instrument of data collection, the study showed that students have positive attitudes to both reading and electronic media but spend more time engaged with use of electronic media especially television. Their purposes of reading were primarily academic and informational, while electronic media were used for entertainment and information seeking. The study provided evidences that the use of electronic media for entertainment has reduced the time available for voluntary reading while factors such as inadequate access to pleasurable reading materials and lack of parental support also hinder reading for pleasure. The study, however, recommended that interesting books be provided and made accessible to the students.

Parents of preschoolers (N = 278, average age 40–76 months) completed questionnaire measures of television use, MR, MH, and dietary intake. Controlling familial demographics, television use during meals was a significant predictor of less MR and preschooler fruit and vegetable intake, but not of MH. Additionally, a three-way interaction between mealtime television use, MR, and MH visualized differing patterns of mean preschooler obesogenic food intake among families with low and high TV mealtime use. Discussion focuses on the importance of continuing to investigate the impact of screen media use on family mealtimes and other rituals related to child health. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children; dietary intake; family; mealtime; media; television",,,,,,"University of Michigan, U-M","This work was supported by University of Michigan’s college of Literature, Science, and the Arts.",,"Anderson, D.R., Evans, M.K., Peril and potential of media for infants and toddlers (2001) Zero to three: National center for infants, toddlers, and families, 22 (2), pp. 10-16. , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285877841, Retrieved from; Bernard-Bonnin, A.C., Rousseau, E., Masson, P., Gilbert, S., Maheux, B., Television and the 3-to 10-year-old child (1991) Pediatrics, 88 (1), pp. 48-54; (2012) National longitudinal survey of youth 1979 cohort, 1979–2010 (rounds 1-24), , Center for Human Resource Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH:.

This study adds to the emotion regulation literature and the affordances of technologies perspective by providing a better understanding of with whom adolescents share emotions on- and offline, how they do this and why they use certain modes. In-depth interviews with 22 Flemish adolescents (aged 14–18) show that these youngsters share almost all experienced emotions, often with multiple recipients and using multiple communication modes. Although they mostly prefer sharing emotions face-to-face, they also share by texting, calling, or posting something on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. Our respondents generally make a more or less conscious decision about what and how to share. The valence, type, and intensity of the emotion, the affordances of the mode, social norms, and impression management concerns influence this decision. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescent; affordances; emotion regulation; face-to-face; mobile phone; online; social media; social sharing of emotion",,,,,,,,,"Agosto, D.E., Abbas, J., Naughton, R., Relationships and social rules: Teens’ social network and other ICT selection practices (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (6), pp. 1108-1124; Bayer, J.B., Ellison, N.B., Schoenebeck, S.Y., Falk, E.B., Sharing the small moments: Ephemeral social interaction on Snapchat (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 19 (7), pp. 956-977; Baym, N.K., (2010) Personal connections in the digital age, , Cambridge: Polity; Bazarova, N.N., Choi, Y.H., Sosik, V., Cosley, D., Whitlock, J., Social sharing of emotions on Facebook: Channel differences, satisfaction, and replies (2015) Presented at the CSCW 2015, , Vancouver, Canada; Bazarova, N.N., Taft, J.G., Choi, Y.H., Cosley, D., Managing impressions and relationships on Facebook: Self-presentational and relational concerns revealed through the analysis of language style (2013) Journal of Language & Social Psychology, 32 (2), pp. 121-141; Bertel, T.F., Ling, R., It’s just not that exciting anymore”: The changing centrality of SMS in the everyday lives of young Danes (2016) New Media & Society, 18 (7), pp. 1293-1309; boyd, D., Social network sites as networked publics: Affordances, dynamics, and implications (2011) A networked self.

We tested whether exposure to screen media is associated with children’s early language development. One hundred and thirty-one highly educated caregivers of UK children aged 6–36 months completed a media exposure questionnaire and vocabulary measure. 99% of children were read to daily, 82% watched television, and 49% used mobile touchscreen devices daily. Regression analyses revealed that time spent reading positively predicted vocabulary comprehension and production scores at 6–18 months, but time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices was not associated with vocabulary scores. Critically, correlations revealed that time spent reading or engaging with other non-screen activities was not offset by time spent engaging with television or mobile touchscreen devices. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest that screen media exposure adversely influenced vocabulary size in our sample of highly educated families with moderate media use. © 2017 The Author(s).

The effect of parental approval of their child’s expression of emotions, on the child’s approval of TV characters expressing the emotion, and the influence of both on the child’s expression of emotions within the past seven days is tested for the emotions fear, sadness, anger, and happiness with a representative survey of children (N = 1458) aged 6–19 in Germany. Moderating age and gender effects were also considered. Consistent across the four emotions, results showed that socialization of emotions via mass media is driven by internalized parental socialization but has a comparably strong effect of its own on the child’s expression of emotion that adds to the variance explained, especially with regard to anger and happiness. Implications for the conceptualization of parental emotion socialization and emotional socialization via media are discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emotion display; emotion expression; emotion regulation; Experienced emotions; favorite TV characters; fear sadness anger happiness; media socialization of emotions; parental mediation of emotions; parental socialization of emotions; representative survey of children and adolescents",,,,,,,,,"Adams, S., Kuebli, J., Boyle, P.A., Fivush, R., Gender differences in parent-child conversations about past emotions: A longitudinal investigation (1995) Sex Roles, 33, pp. 309-323; (2016) American Academy of Pediatrics announces new recommendations for children’s media use, , https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Announces-New-Recommendations-for-Childrens-Media-Use.aspx, Retrieved from; Arnett, J.J., Adolescents’ uses of media for self-socialization (1995) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24, pp. 519-533; Austin, E.W., Effects of family communication on children’s interpretation of television (2001) Television and the American familiy, pp. 377-395. , Bryant J., Bryant J.A., (eds), 2nd ed., Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum,.

As such, Disney content messages–which are often repeatedly viewed by children–and correlating implications should frequently be assessed. The objective for this investigation was to evaluate the portrayal of older adults in more recent Disney animated films (from 2004 to 2016) to provide both an update and comparative analysis to previous explorations. Results suggest comparable findings: we note a similarity in the overall negative portrayal of older characters in recent Disney animated films compared to previous films. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in “neutral” or general aging qualities, as well as a slight increase in the number of older adults depicted as “the villain.” Implications and observations are offered in efforts to improve ageist representations, particularly in a medium that is exceptionally prevalent in the lives of many young people. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ageism; Aging; animated films; children; cultivation; Disney; older adults; representation; stereotypes",,,,,,,,,"Aday, R.H., Aday, K.L., Arnold, J.L., Bendix, S.L., Changing children’s perceptions of the elderly: The effects of intergenerational contact (1996) Gerontology & Geriatrics Education, 16, pp. 37-51; Aday, R.H., Sims, C.R., McDuffie, W., Evans, E., Changing children's attitudes toward the elderly: The longitudinal effects of an intergenerational partners program (1996) Journal of Research in Childhood Education, 10, pp. 143-151; Beres, L., Beauty and the beast: The romanticization of abuse in popular culture (1999) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 2, pp. 191-207; Bishop, J.M., Krause, D.R., Depictions of aging and old age on Saturday morning television (1984) The Gerontologist, 24, pp. 91-94; Blunk, E.M., Williams, S.W., The effects of curriculum on preschool children's perceptions of the elderly (1997) Educational Gerontology, 23, pp. 233-341; Briller, B., TV’s distorted and missing images of women and the elderly (2000) Television Quarterly, 31, pp. 69-74; Butler, R.N., Ageism: A forward (1980) Journal of Social Issues, 36, pp. 8-11; Cassata, M., Irwin, B.J., Young by day: The older person on daytime serial drama (1997) Cross-cultural communication and aging in the United States, pp. 215-230. , Noor Al-Deen H.S., (ed), Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, &,.

Yet, the meanings, causes and consequences of bullying are all disputed. Thus, this paper reports on a qualitative content and discourse analysis of the portrayal of bullying in top circulating newsmagazines in Canada and the US from 2000 to 2014. It focuses on the answers to the following four the questions of what is bullying? What are its consequences? What is said to cause it? What can be done about it? It then offers possible theoretical explanations for the findings through the theories of medicalization, neoliberalism and risk society. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bullying; Canada; children; cyberbullying; newsmagazines; North America; The United States",,,,,,"410-2011-2099","This work was supported by the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [grant number 410-2011-2099].",,"Altheide, D., The news media, the problem frame, and the production of fear (1997) The Sociological Quarterly, 38, pp. 647-668; Altheide, D., Children and the discourse of fear (2002) Symbolic Interaction, 25, pp. 229-250; Andershed, H., Kerr, M., Stattin, H., Bullying in school and violence on the streets: Are the same people involved?

The material is four websites from Swedish companies explicitly offering schoolchildren under 13 opportunities to sell products on commission in order to raise money for school trips. The analysis reveals there is an almost total visual absence of children performing work. Instead focus is placed on joy and on learning skills for the future. Caring adults are highly involved in the work that is described as safe and easy. Any possible negative connotations to exploited child labourers are avoided. These findings contribute to our understanding of how complex and contradictory the image of children is in prosperous societies where children do not have to work for survival, but yet do work. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","child labour; children’s value; children’s work; consumption; middle school; Representations of children; school trip; Sweden; visual analysis; websites",,,,,,,,,"Aretun, Å., (2007) Barns ‘växa vilt’ och vuxnas vilja att forma: Formell och informell socialisation i en muslimsk skola (Diss) [Children as social producers and adults’ wish to shape: Formal and informal socialisation in a muslim school], , Linköpings universitet, Linköping; Boulton, C., Don’t smile for the camera: Black power, para-proxemics and prolepsis in print ads for hip-hop clothing (2007) International Journal of Communication, 1, pp. 758-788. , https://ijoc.org, Retrieved from; Bourdillon, M., Levison, D., Myers, W., White, B., (2010) Rights and wrongs of children’s work, , New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press; Cook, D.T., Pricing the priceless child: A wonderful problematic (2012) The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth, 5, pp. 468-473; Cross, G., Wondrous innocence: Print advertising and the origins of permissive child rearing in the US (2004) Journal of Consumer Culture, 4, pp. 183-201; Website, , https://www.delikatesskungen.se, September 1, 2016,.

The analysis compares U.S. mothers’ and fathers’ mediation, specifically within the larger context of parenting behaviors and media attitudes. Results indicate that there are only a few, small gender differences in parental mediation. Across media, parental mediation was largely predicted by the child’s age, parents’ attitudes about media effects, and levels of parent–child involvement and communication. More involved parents were more frequent mediators for television, video games, and the Internet. Parents who reported frequent talks with children more frequently mediated all four media.

The Spirit of the Beehive (El espíritu de la colmena, Erice, 1973), Raise Ravens (Cría cuervos, Saura, 1976) and Pan’s Labyrinth (El laberinto del fauno, del Toro, 2006) provocatively reimagine childhood temporalities through their opening sequences, cinematography and the depiction of objects of inheritance. For contemporary queer theorists, childhood temporalities facilitate the comprehension of postmodern experiences of time as well as subverting the politics of reproductive futurism centred on the child. In late- and post-Franco Spain, the child’s subversive relationship to time constitutes a direct challenge to the rigid linearity of Francoist historiography and the atomisation of Republican memory and history. Beyond Spanish borders, these films reveal that the figure of the child challenges conceptualisations of chronological time as rigid, fixed, linear and progressive. In the case of transnational co-production Pan’s Labyrinth, this evokes a plethora of histories, concerned with colonial pasts and globalised presents, buried beneath the surface of postmemory cultural production. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Childhood; Cría cuervos; El espíritu de la colmena; El laberinto del fauno; Pan’s Labyrinth; Raise Ravens; Spanish cinema; The Spirit of the Beehive; time",,,,,,,,,"Arocena, C., (1996) Víctor Erice, , Madrid: Ediciones Catedra; Bond Stockton, K., (2009) The queer child, or growing sideways in the twentieth century, , Durham: Duke University Press; Curry, R., Clarifying the enigma: ‘Reading’ Víctor Erice’s El espíritu de la colmena (1996) Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, 73, pp. 269-276; D’Lugo, M., (1991) The films of Carlos Saura: The practice of seeing, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Davies, A., (2012) Spanish spaces, , Liverpool: Liverpool University Press; Deveny, T., (1993) Cain on screen: Contemporary Spanish cinema, , Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press; Doane, M., (2002) The emergence of cinematic time: Modernity, contingency, the archive, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Edelman, L., (2004) No future, , Durham: Duke University Press; Edwards, G., (1995) Indecent exposures: Buñuel, Saura, Erice and Almodóvar, , London: Marion Boyars; Fabian, J., (1983) Time and the other: How anthropology makes its object, , New York, NY: Columbia University Press; Halberstam, J., (2011) The queer art of failure, , Durham: Duke University Press; Halberstam, J., (2012) Gaga feminism: Sex, gender, and the end of normal, , Boston, MA: Beacon Press; Higginbotham, V., (1988) Spanish film under Franco, , Austin: University of Texas Press; Hopewell, J., (1986) Out of the past: Spanish cinema after Franco, , London: BFI Books; Jenkins, H., (1998) The children’s culture reader, , New York, NY: New York University Press, (Ed; Kim, Y., (2005) The family album: Histories, subjectivities, and immigration in contemporary Spanish culture, , Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press; Kincaid, J.R., (1998) Erotic innocence: The culture of child molesting, , Durham: Duke University Press; Kinder, M., (1993) Blood cinema: The reconstruction of national identity in Spain, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Lévi-Strauss, C., (1949) The elementary structures of kinship, , Boston: Beacon Press; Miles, R., ‘Entre dos fuegos’: The function of Teresa and the possible subplot in El espíritu de la colmena (2007) The Journal of Romance Studies, 7, pp. 99-122; Noble, F., (2015) Post-transition transitions: Childhood, performance and immigration in post-Franco Spanish cinema (PhD Thesis), , University of Aberdeen; Prout, R., Cría cuervos (2005) The Cinema of Spain and Portugal, pp. 149-158. , Mira Nouselles A., (ed), London: Wallflower Press,.

Previous research demonstrates that the worldview presented to children on television is extremely heteronormative, but no existing research has examined the issue in a Danish context. The analysis is conducted on two levels: a content analysis of 545 television programs, and interviews with stakeholders in Danish society on the issue “children and sexuality” to examine what the dominant ideas about children and childhood are in today’s society, and how those influence what is considered appropriate for children. We found that representations of sexuality in the programs served to enforce heteronormativity, and failure to behave in a heteronormative way often served as comic relief. None of the stakeholders had considered LGBT children in their work, and it is proposed that the association of homosexuality with sexual activity constructs non-heterosexuality as incompatible with “innocent” childhood, rendering non-heterosexual childhood invisible. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bullying; children’s television; Denmark; families; heteronormativity; homophobia; LGBT; public debates; Sexuality; symbolic annihilation",,,,,,,,,"(2011) Almost Naked Animals, , television series: Toronto: 9 Story Media Group; (2013) Strange Hill High, , television series, London: British Broadcasting Corporation; Callister, M.A., Robinson, T., Clark, B.R., Media portrayals of the family in children’s television programming during the 2005–2006 season in the US (2007) Journal of Children and Media, 1, pp. 142-161; Christensen, C.L., Engaging, critical, entertaining: Transforming public service television for children in Denmark (2013) Interactions: Studies in Communication & Culture, 4, pp. 271-287; Christensen, K.D., I min tid var det nuttet, når de små drenge lavede propellen [In my time it was cute when little boys had their willies out for a swing] (2014) Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, Indland, p. 9. , November 19); Christensen, K.D., Forskere er uenige om behov for seksualpolitik på skoler [Researchers disagree on the need for sexual education in schools] (2014) Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten, Indland, p. 4. , November 20); Clarke, J., Childhood sexuality: Coming of age (2010) Key issues in childhood and youth studies, pp. 64-72. , Kassem D., Murphy L., Taylor E., (eds), London: Routledge,.

Open, frequent, and direct communication about pornography is needed, yet few investigations have explored this area. In aims of providing groundwork for future parent–child pornography communication investigations, the theory of normative social behavior was used to conduct 33 in-depth interviews with parents of at least one middle-school-aged child in the US. Interviews focused on descriptive norms related to societal beliefs about pornography, adolescent exposure to pornography, and the courses of actions that most parents undertake when adolescents are exposed to pornography. Articulated perceptions suggest that most parents view adolescent exposure to pornography as negative although exposure to pornography is becoming more normative for adolescents. Obstacles such as parental fear, discomfort, and a lack in sexual and technological communication openness/knowledge were conveyed. Recommendations related to strengthening parental education about pornography and the importance of overall positive parent–child relationships are offered. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescence;

The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of low-income mothers’ beliefs and practices around their children’s television (TV) use (parental mediation). We administered semi-structured interviews to 296 low-income mothers of children ages four–eight years old in the United States. Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) mothers are confident in restriction of TV content; (2) time limits are not as important as TV content and are only necessary in extreme situations; (3) mothers make meaning of child learning from TV content; (4) mothers identified individual differences in child TV overuse; and (5) mothers’ policy on TV during mealtime depends on how they believe TV to affect child mealtime behaviors and mothers’ mealtime goals.

Because today’s youth are growing up in a digitally saturated world, investigating the technology use of tweens is key to understanding the changing dynamics in parent–child relationships in early adolescence. Through surveys (N = 79) and follow-up focus groups (N = 30) with middle school students, we investigated how tweens described and made sense of their technology use, how they responded to their parents’ rules about technology, and how they navigated technology-related conflicts at home. Tweens perceived a misalignment between their parents’ technology-related rules and their own purposes for using digital media, which they said created a tension between them and their parents. This exploratory study contributes new insight into how tweens relate their technology use to their interpretations of their parents’ rules and messages around technology. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescent development; digital media; digital youth; Early adolescence; parent–child relationships; technology; tweens",,,,,,,,,"Ammari, T., Kumar, P., Lampe, C., Schoenebeck, S., Managing children’s online identities: How parents decide what to disclose about their children online (2015) Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1895-1904. , Seoul, Korea:; Blackwell, L., Gardiner, E., Schoenebeck, S., Managing expectations: Technology tensions among parents and teens (2016) Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, pp. 1390-1401. , San Francisco, CA:; Brito, P.Q., Tweens’ characterization of digital technologies (2012) Computers & Education, 59, pp. 580-593; Burke, M., Adamic, L.A., Marciniak, K., Families on facebook (2013) Proceedings of the 7th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 41-50. , Cambridge, MA:; Clark, L.S., Digital media and the generation gap (2009) Information, Communication & Society, 12, pp. 388-407; Collins, W.A., Steinberg, L., Adolescent development in interpersonal context (2006) Handbook of child psychology, vol. 3: Social, emotional, and personality development, pp. 1003-1067. , Eisenberg N., Damon W., Lerner R.M., (eds), 6th ed., Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Connell, S.L., Lauricella, A.R., Parental co-use of media technology with their young children in the USA (2015) Journal of Children and Media, 9, pp. 5-21; Devitt, K., Roker, D., The role of mobile phones in family communication (2009) Children & Society, 23, pp. 189-202; Gardner, H., Davis, K., (2013) The app generation: How today’s youth navigate identity, intimacy, and imagination in a digital world, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Hiniker, A., Schoenebeck, S.Y., Kientz, J.A., Not at the dinner table: parents’ and children’s perspectives on family technology rules (2016) Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, pp. 1376-1389. , San Francisco, CA:; Kroger, J., (2007) Identity development: Adolescence through adulthood, , 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Mesch, G.S., Family characteristics and intergenerational conflicts over the Internet (2006) Information, Communication & Society, 9, pp. 473-495; Rideout, V.J., (2015) The Common Sense Census: Media use by tweens and teens, , San Francisco: Common Sense Media; Rudi, J., Dworkin, J., Walker, S., Doty, J., Parents’ use of information and communications technologies for family communication: Differences by age of children (2015) Information, Communication & Society, 18, pp. 78-93; Stutzman, F., Hartzog, W., Obscurity by design: An approach to building privacy into social media (2012) CSCW’12 Workshop on Reconciling Privacy with Social Media, , Seattle, WA:; Vaterlaus, J.M., Beckert, T.E., Tulane, S., They always ask what I’m doing and who I’m talking to”: Parental mediation of adolescent interactive technology use (2014) Marriage & Family Review, 50, pp. 691-713; Wei, R., Lo, V.-H., Staying connected while on the move: Cell phone use and social connectedness (2006) New Media & Society, 8, pp. 53-72; Weinstein, E., Davis, K., Connecting ‘round the clock: Mobile phones and adolescents’ experiences of intimacy (2015) Encyclopedia of mobile phone behavior (Volumes 1, 2, and 3), pp. 937-946. , Yan Z., (ed), Hershey, PA: IGI Global; Weisskirch, R.S., No crossed wires: Cell phone communication in parent-adolescent relationships (2011) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 14, pp. 447-451; Yardi, S., Bruckman, A., Social and technical challenges in parenting teens’ social media use (2011) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3237-3246. , Vancouver, BC:; Youniss, J., Smollar, J., (1985) Adolescent relations with mothers, fathers and friends, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press","Kim, A.S.; The Information School, University of WashingtonUnited States; email: kimsk@uw.edu",,,"Routledge",,,,,17482798,,,,"English","J.

In this paper we present the results of a discourse analysis of Facebook comments responding to the proposal that iPads be used by children in early years education. We found that respondents typically drew upon one of three core stances to talk about children and screen-based media use. Of these, the most dominant stance posited that children’s “screen time” was problematic. This popular discourse is out of alignment with government discourses promoting the use of screen-based devices in education. By illuminating the discord between different constructions of childhood, the role of education, and screen-based media this paper contributes to an ecologically valid understanding of the role of digital media in contemporary childhoods. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","childhood; Children; discourse analysis; education; Facebook comments; iPads; screen time; screen-based media; technology",,,,,,,,,"Children, adolescents, and the media (2013) Pediatrics, 132, pp. 958-961; (2015) ABC–Bringing tablets and laptops to school will soon be.., , https://www.facebook.com/abc/posts/10153442997024550; (2014) AVG digital diaries | How technology affects family life, , http://www.avg.com/digitaldiaries/homepage; Burns, J., Extra screen time “hits GCSE grades (2015) BBC News, , http://www.bbc.com/news/education-34139196; Carter, M., Gibbs, M., Arnold, M., The demarcation problem in multiplayer games: Boundary-work in EVE online’s esport (2015) Game Studies, 15 (1). , http://gamestudies.org/1501/articles/carter; Chaudron, S., (2015) Young Children (0–8) and digital technology: A qualitative exploratory study across seven countries, , http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/111111111/33897, Publications Office of the European Union; Cingel, D.P., Krcmar, M., Predicting media use in very young children: The role of demographics and parent attitudes (2013) Communication Studies, 64, pp. 374-394; (2016) Embracing the digital age, , http://www.innovation.gov.au/page/embracing-digital-age; Drotner, K., Dangerous media?

The number of educational games has also significantly increased but little has been to done to assess the effectiveness and validity. Given the increase in access and use of devices, and increased popularity of educational games, a set of principles is needed. We present guiding principles that are useful for the design and development of educational games for children, under 5 years. We provide evidence from child development research findings that games should: (1) be developmentally appropriate content; (2) integrate the theoretical frameworks from the learning science field; (3) embed learning in socially rich contexts; (4) develop diverse content; and (5) create a balance between play and real-world learning opportunities. We build the principles around a hypothetical educational game designed to facilitate language development. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","child development; educational games; Game-based learning; interactive design; language; learning; media; mobile devices; preschool",,,,,,"Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT","This work was funded by the Nayar Prize program at the Illinois Institute of Technology.",,"Alliano, A., Herriger, K., Koutsoftas, A.D., Bartolotta, T.E., A review of 21 iPad applications for augmentative and alternative communication purposes (2012) American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 21, pp. 60-71; Policy statement-Children, adolescents, and the media (2013) Pediatrics, 132, pp. 958-961; Barr, R., Memory constraints on infant learning from picture books, television, and touchscreens (2013) Child Development Perspectives, 7, pp. 205-210; Barr, R., Hayne, H., Developmental changes in imitation from television during infancy (1999) Child Development, 70, pp. 1067-1081; Barr, R., Muentener, P., Garcia, A., Age-related changes in deferred imitation from television by 6- to 18-month-olds (2007) Developmental Science, 10, pp. 910-921; Bates, E., Dick, F., Language, gesture, and the developing brain (2002) Developmental Psychobiology, 40, pp. 293-310; Baumwell, L., Tamis-LeMonda, C.S., Bornstein, M.H., Maternal verbal sensitivity and child language comprehension (1997) Infant Behavior & Development, 20, pp. 247-258; Belsky, J., (2013) Experiencing the Lifespan, , New York, NY: Worth; Bornstein, M.H., Hendricks, C., Haynes, O.M., Painter, K.M., Maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness: Associations with social context, maternal characteristics, and child characteristics in a multivariate analysis (2007) Infancy, 12, pp. 189-223; Brown, A., Shifrin, D.L., Hill, D.L., Beyond “turn it off”: How to advise families on media use (2015) AAP News, p. 54; Buijzen, M., van der Molen, J.H.W., Sondij, P., Parental mediation of children’s emotional responses to a violent news event (2007) Communication Research, 34, pp. 212-230; Burghardt, G.M., The comparative reach of play and brain: Perspective, evidence and implications (2010) American Journal of Play, 2, pp. 338-356; Caillois, R., (1961) Man, play and games, , New York, NY: Free Press; Calvert, S., (1999) Children’s journeys through the information age, , Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill; Conway, C.M., Christiansen, M.H., Modality-constrained statistical learning of tactile, visual, and auditory sequences (2005) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 31, pp. 24-39; (2013) Zero to eight: Children’s media use in America 2013, , Common Sense Media Research Study; de Jong, M.T., Bus, A.G., How well suited are electronic books to supporting literacy?

This study builds upon research on other lifestyle behaviors to explore the impact of a global rating of parent–child relationship quality on recreational media use (RMU). Data from a nationally representative sample of US children and adolescents aged 8–18 years (n = 1727) were analyzed. Multiple linear regression tested the association between parent–child relationship quality and RMU as well as if the association between parent–child relationship quality and RMU varied with age. Overall, higher quality parent–child relationships were associated with lower RMU, but this association was only significant for children aged 11–13 years. This study points to possible intervention strategies to limit excessive media use in children such as improving parent–child relationship quality, especially during the critical period of the pre-teen years. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescent; child; family; media use; parent–child relations; television",,,,,,,,,"Bowen, M., (1993) Family therapy in clinical practice, , New York, NY: Jason Aronson; Chan, D.K., Lonsdale, C., Fung, H.H., Influences of coaches, parents, and peers on the motivational patterns of child and adolescent athletes (2012) Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 22, pp. 558-568; Cohen, D.A., Scribner, R.A., Farley, T.A., A structural model of health behavior: A pragmatic approach to explain and influence health behaviors at the population level (2000) Preventive Medicine, 30, pp. 146-154; Collins, W.A., Madsen, S.D., Susman-Stillman, A., Parenting during middle childhood (2005) Handbook of parenting, 1, pp. 73-101; Frech, A., Healthy behavior trajectories between adolescence and young adulthood (2012) Advances in Life Course Research, 17, pp. 59-68; Gentile, D.A., Reimer, R.A., Nathanson, A.I., Walsh, D.A., Eisenmann, J.C., Protective effects of parental monitoring of children’s media use (2014) JAMA Pediatrics, 168, pp. 479-484; Goldberg, J.S., Carlson, M.J., Parents’ relationship quality and children’s behavior in stable married and cohabiting families (2014) Journal of Marriage and Family, 76, pp. 762-777; Kitzman-Ulrich, H., Wilson, D.K., St George, S.M., Lawman, H., Segal, M., Fairchild, A., The integration of a family systems approach for understanding youth obesity, physical activity, and dietary programs (2010) Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review, 13, pp. 231-253; Lauricella, A.R., Wartella, E., Rideout, V.J., Young children’s screen time: The complex role of parent and child factors (2015) Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 36, pp. 11-17; Leary, J.M., Lilly, C.L., Dino, G., Loprinzi, P.D., Cottrell, L., Parental influences on 7–9 year olds’ physical activity: a conceptual model (2013) Preventive Medicine, 56, pp. 341-344; Lee, S.J., Bartolic, S., Vandewater, E.A., Predicting children’s media use in the USA: Differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis (2009) The British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 27, pp. 123-143; Nathanson, A.I., Identifying and explaining the relationship between parental mediation and children’s aggression (1999) Communication Research, 26, pp. 124-143; Nikken, P., Jansz, J., Parental mediation of children’s videogame playing: A comparison of the reports by parents and children (2006) Learning, Media and Technology, 31, pp. 181-202; Ornelas, I.J., Perreira, K.M., Ayala, G.X., Parental influences on adolescent physical activity: a longitudinal study (2007) International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, 4, p. 3; Rideout, V.J., Foehr, U.G., Roberts, D.F., (2010) Generation M2: Media in the lives of 8-to 18-year-olds, , https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8010.pdf, Kaiser H.J., (ed), Menlo Park, CA:; Schumm, W.R., McCollum, E.E., Bugaighis, M.A., Jurich, A.P., Bollman, S.R., Characteristics of the Kansas Family Life Satisfaction Scale in a regional sample (1986) Psychological Reports, pp. 975-980; Simons-Morton, B.G., Haynie, D.L., Application of authoritative parenting to adolescent health behavior (2002) Emerging theories and models in health promotion research and practice, pp. 100-125. , DiClemente R., Crosby R., Kegler M., (eds), San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; St George, S.M., Wilson, D.K., Schneider, E.M., Alia, K.A., Project SHINE: Effects of parent-adolescent communication on sedentary behavior in African American adolescents (2013) Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 38, pp. 997-1009; Zillmann, D., Bryant, J., Huston, A.C., (2013) Media, children, and the family: Social scientific, psychodynamic, and clinical perspectives, , New York, NY: Routledge","Jake-Schoffman, D.E.; Division of Preventive and Behavioral Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical SchoolUnited States; email: Danielle.JakeSchoffman@umassmed.edu",,,"Routledge",,,,,17482798,,,,"English","J.

Moreover, the study investigated how attention problems are related to computer-based multitasking and how these individual differences interact with age. Computer-based multitasking was observed for a 10-minute period among children (N = 164, aged 6–13) and adults (N = 160, aged 18–75) in the Netherlands. The findings indicated that individuals find it indeed difficult to focus their attention on a main activity in the presence of appealing media distractors. A main effect for age was qualified by an interaction effect between age and attention problems. There was a positive relationship between attention problems and computer-based multitasking only for children but not for adults. The findings indicate that particularly children with attention problems are easily distracted by other media activities. © 2017 The Author(s).

Studies have measured adult conceptions of their own parasocial relationships and parent perceptions of their children’s parasocial relationships, but little is known about how to quantify young children’s perceptions of their own parasocial relationships. In this study, a child self-report survey was developed based on prior parental surveys and behavioral measures to operationalize children’s parasocial relationships. Results revealed that 2–6 year-old U.S. children can name and report about their favorite media characters, who were the target for assessing parasocial relationships. Factor analyses indicated three components of children’s parasocial relationships: attachment and friendship, humanlike needs, and social realism. Although the internal consistency improved with age on attachment and friendship and social realism, only the attachment and friendship subscale reached conventional acceptable levels of internal consistency. This study provides a new method for operationalizing children’s parasocial relationships through child interview and describes future research directions for improving the internal consistency of the child subscales. © 2017, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

However, longitudinal research on the relationships between (sexy) online self-presentation and adolescents’ gender role orientation is lacking. The present study investigated whether endorsing a stereotypical gender role orientation (i.e., hypermasculinity for boys, hyperfemininity for girls) predisposes adolescents to engage in sexy self-presentation or to look at others’ sexy self-presentations in social media. In addition, we investigated whether engaging in sexy self-presentation and looking at others’ sexy self-presentation predicted an increased hypergender orientation over time. Using a three-wave short-term longitudinal panel survey among 1467 Dutch adolescents with six-month time intervals between waves, we found that adolescents’ hypergender orientation predicted more frequent sexy self-presentation and exposure to others’ sexy self-presentations in social media.

Accordingly, children’s news programs have been developed with the aim of adapting news for children. Research examining program creators’ perspectives on news adaptation for children has primarily focused on the creators’ views of wars or on others crisis coverage. The current study addresses the production of routine children’s news by examining the unique context of Israel. Interviews with 15 creators reflect the belief that news should be adapted to children’s cognitive and emotional abilities by ensuring that such news is comprehensible and palatable, featuring both standard news items and content pertaining to children’s lives, achieving a balance between heavier and lighter content, and generating a youthful atmosphere. The implications of these findings and the questions that arise are discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children’s news programs; educational television; news in Israel; news production; political socialization",,,,,,,,,"Alon-Tirosh, M., Lemish, D., If I was making news”: What do children want from news?

This interdisciplinary study explored the transformative potential of early critical media literacy practices as a medium to prompt authentic discussions about gender with young bilingual children. Adopting a qualitative case study approach, the current article focuses on kindergarten-age Korean-English bilingual children at the Korean Language School in a city in the Midwest United States. Multi-modal data were collected for a semester through classroom observations, one-to-one interviews with the parents and teacher, and the children’s artifacts. The findings suggest that critical media practice can offer young bilingual children a wide range of opportunities for critically examining gender representations in online storybooks and questioning dominant gender ideologies. The practical implications for early-years’ teachers and educators in the twenty-first century are also discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bilingual; Critical media literacy; gender; Korean; online storybooks",,,,,,,,,"Adebowale, S.A., Yusuf, O.B., Palmuleni, E.A., Child’s gender preference: What is the regional situation among women in Nigeria?

To this end, interviews with 60 preschool-aged children from childcare centers in Northern Virginia were conducted. Children were shown five toy advertisements (two male-targeted, two female-targeted, one neutral) and asked about gender classification as well as commercial preferences, which were assessed verbally and behaviorally. Results revealed stereotype flexibility as well as rigidity. Some level of flexibility was seen in all areas. Rigidity was most pronounced in the children’s emotional response to the ads and in their choice of favorite commercial. Moreover, in boys, adherence to stereotypes was more prominent and increased with age. Preschoolers’ perceptions of gendered toy commercials are multifaceted and more work is needed to understand the influences that shape them. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","child-directed advertising; gender; Preschool; stereotypes; toy commercials",,,,,,,,,"Bartsch, R.A., Burnett, T., Diller, T.R., Rankin-Williams, E., Gender representation in television commercials: Updating an update (2000) Sex Roles, 43, pp. 735-743; Blakemore, J.E.O., Centers, R.E., Characteristics of boys’ and girls’ toys (2005) Sex Roles, 53, pp. 619-633; Buckingham, D., (1993) Reading audiences: Young people and the media, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Calvert, S.L., Huston, A.C., Television and children’s gender schemata (1987) New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 1987, pp. 75-88; Carter, D.B., Levy, G.D., Cognitive aspects of early sex-role development: The influence of gender schemas on preschoolers’ memories and preferences for sex-typed toys and activities (1988) Child Development, 59, pp. 782-792; Cherney, I.D., London, K., Gender-linked differences in the toys, television shows, computer games, and outdoor activities of 5- to 13-year-old children (2006) Sex Roles, 54, pp. 717-726; Cobb, N.J., Stevens-Long, J., Goldstein, S., The influence of televised models on toy preference in children (1982) Sex Roles, 8, pp. 1075-1080; Davis, S.N., Sex stereotypes in commercials targeted toward children: A content analysis (2003) Sociological Spectrum, 23, pp. 407-424; Eisenberg, N., Tryon, K., Cameron, E., The relation of preschoolers’ peer interaction to their sex-typed toy choices (1984) Child Development, 55, pp. 1044-1050; Flerx, C.F., Fidler, D.S., Rogers, R.W., Sex role stereotypes: Developmental aspects and early intervention (1976) Child Development, 47, pp. 998-1007; Freeman, N., Preschoolers’ perceptions of gender appropriate toys and their parents’ beliefs about genderized behaviors: Miscommunication, mixed messages, or hidden truths?

Here, we examined young children’s recognition, attribution of functions, and preference for using touchscreens as opposed to other devices. Forty-three preschoolers answered questions regarding six devices; for comparison, a group of 16 adults was also tested. Children recognized the devices as well as adults, but attributed fewer functions to touchscreen devices than did adults. However, compared to other media, children attributed more and different functions to touchscreens. Interestingly, children did not uniformly prefer touchscreen devices, but chose selectively for different tasks. The results show surprising differences from adult users as well as a developing understanding among young children regarding media tools. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","learning; media preferences; Media use; reasoning about media; touchscreen devices",,,,,,"International Max Planck Research School for Advanced Methods in Process and Systems Engineering

This relationship is most typically attributed to the influence of food advertising. Despite this growing array of studies, one limitation is that these studies have focused almost exclusively on high-income countries. It is unclear whether such findings hold true in low- or middle-income countries. To address this gap, this study investigated the relationship between television exposure and unhealthy snack consumption (a risk factor for childhood overweight/obesity) in a sample of Peruvian children aged 6–13 (n = 265). Results indicate that television exposure is indeed cross-sectionally and longitudinally related with unhealthy snack consumption. But for children from high socioeconomic status families, this relationship is even more pronounced. These findings justify efforts to help parents manage their children’s television viewing as well as efforts to regulate food advertising in Peru. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children; latin america; obesity/overweight; socioeconomic status; television",,,,,,"International Development Research Centre, IDRC: 106886-001","This work was supported by International Development Research Centre [grant number 106886-001].

However, the popularity of video communication by young children has yet been determined. Although some research has shown similarities between young children’s experience of a parent’s physical and virtual presence, little is known about the ecological applications of video communication and its benefits to young children. Using a brief quantitative questionnaire, this study shows that younger children started video communication at significantly earlier ages than the older children in the sample (n = 308). Qualitative responses from parents of 17 children suggested different perceptions of their children's video communication experience. These preliminary findings are considered in the context of the value of video communication in different situations, the developmental factors associated with screen media including memory transfer across modalities, and the development of skills that facilitate effective communication. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Child; computer-mediated interaction; development family; interactivity; screen media; social engagement; technology; video communication",,,,,,,,,"(2013) 4-traders.com, , http://www.4-traders.com/ABERDEEN-ASSET-MANAGEMENT-9583548/news/Aberdeen-Asset-Management-plc–Skype-helps-sick-children-stay-in-touch-17645644/; Ahrons, C.R., Family ties after divorce: Long-term implications for children (2007) Family Process, 46, pp. 53-65; (2008) Family characteristics and transitions, Australia, 2006–07, , http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4442.0; Ballagas, R., Kaye, J.J., Ames, M., Go, J., Raffle, H., (2009) Family communication: Phone conversations with children, , Paper presented at the proceedings of the 8th international conference on Interaction Design and Children, Como, Italy; Bengtson, V.L., Beyond the nuclear family: The increasing importance of multigenerational bonds (2001) Journal of Marriage and Family, 63 (1), pp. 1-16; Bowlby, J., (1951) Maternal care and mental health, , Geneva: World Health Organization; Brookes, H., Slater, A., Quinn, P.C., Lewkowicz, D.J., Hayes, R., Brown, E., Three-month-old infants learn arbitrary auditory–visual pairings between voices and faces (2001) Infant and Child Development, 10, pp. 75-82; Burnham, D., Visual recognition of mother by young infants: facilitation by speech (1993) Perception, 22, pp. 1133-1153; (2009) FamCA 7 (12 January 2009); Cochran, M.M., Brassard, J.A., Child development and personal social networks (1979) Child Development, 50, pp. 601-616; Denham, T.E., Smith, C.W., The influence of grandparents on grandchildren: A review of the literature and resources (1989) Family Relations, 38, pp. 345-350; Doyle, M., O'Dywer, C., Timonen, V., How can you just cut off a whole side of the family and say move on?” The reshaping of paternal grandparent-grandchild relationships following divorce or separation in the middle generation (2010) Family Relations, 59, pp. 587-598; (2014) Global expatriates: Size, segmentation and forecast for the Worldwide market [Press release], , http://www.finaccord.com/press-release_2014_global-expatriates_-size-segmentation-and-forecast-for-the-worldwide-market.htm; Fleischer, M., (2012) Washington Times, , http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/legally-speaking/2012/apr/15/virtual-visitation-sensible-child-custody-option/; Follmer, S., Raffle, H., Go, J., Ballagas, R., Ishii, H., (2010) Video play: Playful interactions in video conferencing for long-distance families with young children, , Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Interaction Design and Children, Barcelona, Spain; (2008) FMCAfam 1304 (9 December 2008); Hayne, H., Infant memory development: Implications for childhood amnesia (2004) Developmental Review, 24, pp. 33-73; Hone-McMahan, K., (2011) Herald Extra, , http://www.heraldextra.com/momclick/parenting/article_11c7d134-9f40-11e0-ab78-001cc4c03286.html#ixzz1QRBRZkXa; (2010) News, Zycko, , http://www.zycko.com/news/800048517; McCann, K., I'm an astronaut, I need some space The Guardian, , http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/07/nasa-astronaut-cady-coleman; Meyers, D., Virtual visitation rights New York Times, p.

A large-scale quantitative survey study among 1787 Flemish high school pupils in 2010 revealed that, in the six months prior to the study, 25% of adolescents had made a picture/video of a peer who was being ridiculed, 8% of a peer who was being physically bullied, and 11% had distributed such a picture/video online. Thirteen percent had made a picture/video of a teacher being ridiculed, and 6% had distributed such content online. Self-perceived popularity, need for popularity, and perceived peer pressure positively predicted adolescents’ involvement in several of the above practices.

To gain a deeper understanding of young peoples’ experiences of digital technology and cyberbullying, four focus groups were conducted with 29 11- to 15-year-olds recruited from two schools. Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed three themes: impact of technology, vulnerability and cyberbullying. Technology was seen as a facilitator and a mechanism for maintaining social interactions. However, participants reported experiencing a conflict between the need to be sociable and the desire to maintain privacy. Cyberbullying was regarded as the actions of an anonymous coward who sought to disrupt social networks and acts should be distinguished from banter. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cyberbullying; online vulnerability; risk",,,,,,"British Academy: SG121267","This research was funded by a small grant from the British Academy awarded to the first author [grant number SG121267].",,"Anderson, T., Sturm, B., Cyberbullying: From playground to computer (2007) Youth Adult Library Services, 5 (2), pp. 24-27; Ando, R., Sakamoto, A., The effect of cyber-friends on loneliness and social anxiety: Differences between high and low self-evaluated physical attractiveness groups (2008) Computers in Human Behavior, 24, pp. 993-1009; Beale, A.V., Hall, K.R., Cyberbullying: What school administrators (and parents) can do (2007) The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas, 81, pp. 8-12; Braun, C., Clarke, V., (2013) Successful qualitative research: A practical guide for beginners, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Cassidy, W., Faucher, C., Jackson, M., Cyberbullying among youth: A comprehensive review of current international research and its implications and application to policy and practice (2013) School Psychology International, 34, pp. 575-612; Cassidy, W., Jackson, M., Brown, K., Sticks and stones can break my bones, but how can pixels hurt Me?: Students’ experiences with cyber-bullying (2009) School Psychology International, 30, pp. 383-402; Chayko, M., Techno-social life: The internet, digital technology, and social connectedness (2014) Sociology Compass, 8, pp. 976-991; Cho, H., Lee, J., Chung, S., Optimistic bias about online privacy risks: Testing the moderating effects of perceived controllability and prior experience (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26, pp. 987-995; Clarke, C., An introduction to interpretative phenomenological analysis: A useful approach for occupational therapy research (2009) The British Journal of Occupational Therapy, 72, pp. 37-39; Davies, K., Randall, D.P., Ambrose, A., Orand, M., ‘I was bullied too’: Stories of bullying and coping in an online community (2014) Information, Communication & Society, 18, pp. 357-375; Davis, F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology (1989) MIS Quarterly, 13, pp. 319-340; Davis, F.D., Bagozzi, R.P., Warshaw, P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models (1989) Management Science, 35, pp. 982-1003; Dempsey, A.G., Sulkowski, M.L., Nichols, R., Storch, E.A., Differences between peer victimization in cyber and physical settings and associated psychosocial adjustment in early adolescence (2009) Psychology in the Schools, 46, pp. 962-972; Dynel, M., No aggression, only teasing: The pragmatics of teasing and banter (2008) Lodz Papers in Pragmatics, 4, pp. 241-261; Eliot, M., Cornell, D., Gregory, A., Fan, X., Supportive school climate and student willingness to seek help for bullying and threats of violence (2010) Journal of School Psychology, 48, pp. 533-553; Erdur-Baker, O., Cyberbullying and its correlation to traditional bullying, gender and frequent and risky usage of internet-mediated communication tools (2010) New Media & Society, 12, pp. 109-125; Erickson, J., Johnson, G.M., Internet use and psychological wellness during late adulthood (2011) Canadian Journal on Aging/La Revue canadienne du vieillissement, 30, pp. 197-209; Espelage, D.L., Swearer, S.M., Research on school bullying and victimization: What have we learned and where do we go from here?

This paper examines this response through the case of the Israeli commercial preschool channel Hop!, using media responsibility and corporate social responsibility as analytical frameworks for the network’s off-screen operations. Ethnographic research revealed three types of off-screen activities: (1) activities geared at maintaining a relationship with the public; (2) ongoing, non-publicized activities; and (3) activities responding to national emergencies, enhancing the network’s “local” image and reinforcing ties with its viewers. Together, these activities reveal the conflict between the commercial imperative for a private channel to turn a profit, and the ethical responsibilities entailed in broadcasting to children, as well as some of the advantages of local over global networks in the preschool context. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corporate social responsibility; Israel; media production; Media responsibility; off-screen activities; preschool television",,,,,,,,,"Aries, P., (1962) Centuries of childhood: A social history of family life, , New York, NY: A.A.

Based on qualitative interviews with 20 central producers, who worked in Israel’s leading channels for children, the article examines the significant changes that occurred in the production field of television for children: from past broadcasts of only public and educational nature in a single Israeli channel, to the current reality of a great number of private channels, some globally owned, broadcasting mainly entertainment. Using Pierre Bourdieu’s cultural theories, this work analyzes the changes that took place in the collective conventions and practices in children’s television in Israel, and in its producers’ concept of childhood: from a national educational service for children, to looking at children as consumers in a media market. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","childhood; Children’s television; culture; entertainment conglomerates; global media; Israel; media history; production research",,,,,,,,,"Adoni, H., Nossek, H., Watching cable television: Social implications for the national identity (1997) Media and democracy, pp. 97-119. , Caspi D., (ed), Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuhad; Aroldi, P., (2015) Public service broadcasting and kids TV in Italy, 1954–2014, , Paper presented at the story of children’s television conference, University of Warwick, Warwick, UK:; Banet-Weiser, S., (2007) Kids rule!

Presenting the initial findings of explorative ethnographic work within one multi-household stepfamily and one divorced one-parent household in Belgium, this article points to the challenges of internet mediation in new family forms as it involves complex interpersonal dynamics that are the result of major changes in family life, and the fact that parenting is distributed between parents in different households with their own media use norms. Specifically, this study found that children in multi-household families experience different mediation regimes and navigate relatively easily between them, but also that post-divorce family life can generate dynamics that mitigate the outcomes of parental mediation, as well as intensify the role of peer-siblings in internet mediation. Methodological implications and suggestions for future family media research are discussed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Children; ethnographic interviews; internet; one-parent family; parental mediation; parents; stepfamily",,,,,,,,,"Alasuutari, P., (1995) Researching culture: Qualitative method and cultural studies, , London: Sage; Baumrind, D., Child care practices anteceding three patterns of preschool behavior (1967) Genetic Psychology Monographs, 75, pp. 43-88; Benoit, D., Infant-parent attachment: Definition, types, antecedents, measurement and outcome (2004) Paediatrics & Child Health, 9, pp. 541-545; Billari, F., Life course analysis: two (complementary) cultures?

Drawing on workshop discussions with mid-adolescents, we suggest that there is a digital gap in this cross-generation communication despite high Information and Communication Technology (ICT) penetration in the market. The gap appears to be a manifestation of the social dynamic at play when reshaping the relationship between adolescents and their caregivers. This dynamic includes both centrifugal and centripetal forces. Applying the perspective of relational dialectics, we elaborate on how these forces unfold in the domestication of an increasingly complex set of communication tools referred to as polymedia. The empirical analysis suggests that teens assess the tools differently depending on if it is for interaction with parents or grandparents. This is also related to whether the mediated communication sessions are instrumentally or expressively skewed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescence; Communication; cross-generation; domestication; grandparents; mobile internet; parents; polymedia; smartphones; strong ties; teens",,,,,,,,,"Baxter, L.A., Montgomery, B.M., Dialogism and relational dialectics (1998) Dialectical approaches to studying personal relationships, pp. 155-184. , Montgomery B.M., Baxter L.A., (eds), Hove: Psychology Press; Baym, N., (2010) Personal connections in the digital age, , Cambridge: Polity; Baym, N., Zhang, Y.B., Lin, M.-C., Social Interaction Across Media (2004) New Media & Society, 6, pp. 299-318; boyd, D., (2014) It’s complicated.

The fact that the majority of these personalities are slim, young, and White men, and the unquestioned truism among TV producers that children prefer such hosts, led an international research team to ask 3399 youth ages 7–10 from 27 countries to describe their ideal host, as well as themselves, through linguistically sensitive and age-appropriate surveys. Key findings include that the same percentage of boys and girls (84%) prefer hosts of the same gender, and that children self-identifying as having non-“light” skin tones are far less likely than those with a “light” skin tone to prefer hosts of the same skin color. These results suggest that marginalized children worldwide struggle to see themselves represented through respected TV figures, which has broader implications for their identity development and socialization. © 2016 Bavarian Broadcast Corporation, Department: International Central Institute for Youth and Educational TV (IZI).","Children’s television; cross-cultural research; diversity; gender",,,,,,,,,"Asamen, J.K., Ellis, M.L., Berry, G.L., (2008) The Sage handbook of child development, multiculturalism, and media, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Calvert, S.L., Kotler, J.A., Zehnder, S.M., Shockey, E.M., Gender stereotyping in children’s reports about educational and informational television programs (2003) Media Psychology, 5, pp. 139-162; Fisch, S.M., (2004) Children’s learning from educational television.

Journalists choose to construct news items related to children by focusing the story around an adult figure, most often a politician, and giving his/her views on the issue being discussed, which points to unequal power relations between children and adults. A monitoring process over a period of three months was carried out for three national television channels. From a total of 4416 news items, 154 items were identified and were subject to further quantitative and qualitative content analyses. Based on our findings, news media portray children in limited roles as objects of emotional appeal, victims or performers. How news media think of and represent children can play a crucial role in shaping our perceptions of them and their positioning in society. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult gaze; Albania; children; representation; Television news",,,,,,,,,"Alanen, L., Mayall, B., (2001) Conceptualizing child-adult relations, , London: Routledge, Falmer; Altheide, D.L., Children and the discourse of fear (2002) Symbolic Interaction, 25, pp. 229-250; (2014) Kodi i Transmetimit, , Tirane: Author; (2009) The rights of children and the right to media, , Brasilia: News agency for children’s rights; Aqtashi, N.A., Seif, A., Seif, A., Media coverage of Palestinian children and the Intifada (2004) International Communication Gazette, 66, pp. 383-409; Brooks, R., Meltzoff, A.N., Mikulincer, M., Shaver, P.R., Gaze following: A mechanism for building social connections between infants and adults (2014) Mechanisms of Social connection: From brain to group, pp. 167-183. , Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; Buckingham, D., Young people, politics and news media: Beyond political socialisation (1999) Oxford Review of Education, 25, pp. 171-184; Carter, C., News media and child well-being (2014) Ben-Arieh, handbook of child well-being, pp. 1979-2011. , Asher F.C., (ed), New York, NY: Springer; Carter, C., Davies, M.M., Allan, S., Mendes, K., Milani, R., Wass, L., (2009) What do children want from the BBC?

Prior research has collected data on young children’s PSR by surveying parents, while other studies have relied directly on child interview. The current study is the first to compare children’s answers to those of their parents. Factor analyses revealed that parents and children both reported three components of children’s PSR: social realism, attachment and character personification (parents) or attachment and friendship (for their children), and humanlike needs. Both parent and child reports accounted for approximately 60% of the variance in children’s PSR. Nonetheless, only approximately one-third of parents and children reported on the same favorite character. The implications for research on children’s PSR using both parent and child reports are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","child interview; media characters; Parasocial relationships; parent survey; young children",,,,,,,,,"Bond, B.J., Calvert, S.L., A model and measure of US parents’ perceptions of young children’s parasocial relationships (2014) Journal of Children and Media, 8, pp. 286-304; Bond, B.J., Calvert, S.L., Parasocial breakup among young children in the United States (2014) Journal of Children and Media, 8, pp. 474-490; Bowlby, J., (1969) Attachment and loss, , New York, NY: Basic Books; Calvert, S.L., Children and digital media (2015) Handbook of Child Psychology and Developmental Science, pp. 375-415. , Bornstein M., Leventhal T., Lerner R., (eds), Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Calvert, S.L., Kotler, J.A., Zehnder, S., Shockey, E., Gender stereotyping in children’s reports about educational and informational television programs (2003) Media Psychology, 5, pp. 139-162; Calvert, S.L., Richards, M.N., Children’s parasocial relationships with media characters (2014) Media and the well being of children and adolescents, pp. 187-200. , Bossert J., Jordan A., Romer D., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press; Calvert, S.L., Richards, M.N., (2015) Parent versus child report of young children’s parasocial relationships, , Poster presented at Association for Psychological Science Annual Conference, New York, NY:; Calvert, S.L., Richards, M.N., Kent, C.C., Personalized interactive characters for toddlers’ learning of seriation from a video presentation (2014) Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 35, pp. 148-155; Cole, T., Leets, L., Attachment styles and intimate television viewing: Insecurely forming relationships in a parasocial way (1999) Journal of Social & Personal Relationships, 16, pp. 495-511; (2013) Zero to eight: Children’s media use in America 2013, , San Francisco, CA: Author; DeVellis, R., (2003) Scale development: Theory and applications, , London: Sage; DiLalla, L.F., Watson, M.W., Differentiation of fantasy and reality: Preschoolers’ reactions to interruptions in their play (1988) Developmental Psychology, 24, pp. 286-291; Eyal, K., Rubin, A.M., Viewer aggression and homophily, identification, and parasocial relationships with television characters (2003) Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 47, pp. 77-98; Giles, D.C., Parasocial interaction: A review of the literature and a model for future research (2002) Media Psychology, 4, pp. 279-305; Gola, A.A.H., Richards, M.N., Lauricella, A.R., Calvert, S.L., Building meaningful parasocial relationships between toddlers and media characters to teach early mathematical skills (2013) Media Psychology, 16, pp. 1-22; Hoffner, C., Children’s wishful identification and parasocial interaction with favorite television characters (1996) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 40, pp. 389-402; Hoffner, C., Parasocial and online social relationships (2008) The handbook of children, media, and development, pp. 309-333. , Calvert S.L., Wilson B.J., (eds), Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell; Horton, D., Wohl, R.R., Mass communication and para-social interaction: Observations on intimacy at a distance (1956) Psychiatry, 19, pp. 215-229; Houlberg, R., Local television news audience and the para-social interaction (1984) Journal of Broadcasting, 28, pp. 423-429; Kassing, J.W., Sanderson, J., You’re the kind of guy that we all want for a drinking buddy: Expressions of Parasocial Interaction on Floydlandis.com (2009) Western Journal of Communication, 73, pp. 182-203; Krcmar, M., Can social meaningfulness and repeat exposure help infants and toddlers overcome the video deficit?

In addition, we explore how these adolescents use social media in their romantic relationships. Data are from five focus groups with 44 Latino adolescents (M = 16.39 years old; 59% female) in the US Midwest. Findings indicate that Latino adolescents believe media portray unrealistic ideals of romantic relationships, yet these teens also see the portrayals as ideals to which they should aspire. When it comes to social media, the youth perceived one-to-one mediated communication (e.g. Skype) as beneficial to their romantic relationships, but evaluated one-to-many mediated communication (e.g. Facebook, Instagram) as largely negative. Our findings identify three sources of evidence in the latter context that create relational uncertainty: (1) visual, (2) partner communication, and (3) third-party communication. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Facebook;

Whilst some frameworks have been developed within the context of media use (e.g., uses and gratifications), others look to combine general theories of basic human needs, such as Self-Determination Theory with hedonic gratifications. Drawing on these approaches, a framework is proposed that maps findings from children’s and adolescents’ media use to four basic human needs: competence, autonomy, relatedness, and hedonic needs. The current paper argues that a basic needs approach is useful for understanding how media-related needs emerge and are expressed through development. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescents;

Notwithstanding the abundance of magical hexes, witches and wand-waving that characterise the series, young people’s talk is found to veer towards emotional matters, relationships and real-life elements. The paper argues that this propensity to extract touches of reality out of the world of fantasy, is not visible in aspirations towards an unreachable, “magic” world hidden somewhere which young people believe really exists, but rather in drawing out of the world of fantasy, elements of everyday life, complete with its characters, bonds, rapports, attachments and socio-cultural references. Analysing data from fieldwork with teen audiences of the Harry Potter series, this paper explores ways in which young people find a sense of location, rooting and grounding in reading fantasy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","audiences; Fantasy; Harry Potter; young people",,,,,,,,,"Anatole, G., Introduction (2003) Reading Harry Potter: Critical essays, pp. 1-9. , Anatole G., (ed), Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers; Anatole, G., The fallen empire: Exploring ethnic otherness in the world of Harry Potter (2003) Reading Harry Potter: Critical essays, pp. 163-178. , Anatole G., (ed), Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers; Bahk, C.M., Drench effects of media portrayal of fatal virus disease on health locus of control beliefs (2001) Health Communication, 13, pp. 187-204; Black, S., Harry Potter: A magical prescription for just about anyone (2003) Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, 46, pp. 540-544; Bogdan, R., Biklen, S.K., (1997) Qualitative research for education, , Allyn & Bacon; Burke, K., Literature as equipment for living (1973) Philosophy of the literary form: Studies in symbolic action, pp. 293-304. , Burke K., (ed), 3rd ed., Berkeley: University of California Press; Burke, K., (1984) Permanence and change: An anatomy of purpose, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Busselle, R.W., Greenberg, B.S., The nature of television realism judgments: A reevaluation of their conceptualization and measurement (2000) Mass Communication & Society, 3, pp. 249-268; Carey, B., Hermione and the House Elves: The literary and historical contexts of JK Rowling’s anti-slavery campaign (2003) Reading Harry Potter: Critical essays, pp. 103-116. , Anatole G., (ed), Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers; Das, R., Converging perspectives in audience studies and digital literacies: Youthful interpretations of an online genre (2011) European Journal of Communication, 26, pp. 343-360; Das, R., The task of interpretation: Children walking “Facebook streets (2012) Participations: The International Journal of Audience and Reception Studies, , 2012 (May); Das, R., ‘To be number one in someone’s eyes …’: Children’s introspections about close relationships in reading Harry Potter (2013) European Journal of Communication, 28, pp. 454-469; Eco, U., (1979) The role of the reader: Explorations in the semiotics of texts, , Bloomington: Indiana University Press; Evans, E.J., Character, audience agency and transmedia drama (2008) Media, Culture & Society, 30, pp. 197-213; Gallardo-C, S., Jason-Smith, C., Cinderfella: JK Rowling’s Wiley web of gender (2003) Reading Harry Potter: Critical essays, pp. 191-206. , Anatole G., (ed), Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers; Götz, M., Lemish, D., Moon, H., Aidman, A., (2014) Media and the make-believe worlds of children: When Harry Potter meets Pokémon in Disneyland, , Oxon: Routledge; Hall, A., Reading realism: Audiences' evaluations of the reality of media texts (2003) Journal of Communication, 53, pp. 624-641; Iser, W., (1974) The implied reader: Patterns of communication in prose fiction from Bunyan to Beckett, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Iser, W., (1978) The act of reading: A theory of aesthetic response, , Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; Jauss, H.R., (1982) Toward an aesthetic of reception, , Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press; Johnson, A., Del Rio, E., Kemmitt, A., Missing the joke: A reception analysis of satirical texts (2010) Communication, Culture & Critique, 3, pp. 396-415; Kidd, D., Harry Potter and the functions of popular culture (2007) The Journal of Popular Culture, 40, pp. 69-89; Lofland, J., (1971) Analysing social settings: A guide to qualitative observation and analysis, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Miles, M.B., Huberman, A.M., (1994) Qualitative data analysis: An expanded sourcebook, , London: Sage; Neumann, I.B., Pop goes religion: Harry Potter meets Clifford Geertz (2006) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 9, pp. 81-100; Ostry, E., Accepting mudbloods: The ambivalent social vision of JK Rowling’s fairy tales (2003) Reading Harry Potter: Critical essays2, pp. 89-102. , Anatole G., (ed), Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers; Park, J., Class and socio-economic identity in Potter’s England (2003) Reading Harry Potter: Critical essays, pp. 179-190. , Anatole G., (ed), Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers; Slater, M.D., Rouner, D., Entertainment—education and elaboration likelihood: Understanding the processing of narrative persuasion (2002) Communication Theory, 12, pp. 173-191; Zunshine, L., (2006) Why we read fiction: Theory of mind and the novel, , Columbus, GA: Ohio State University Press","Das, R.; Department of Media and Communication, University of LeicesterUnited Kingdom; email: rd207@le.ac.uk",,,"Routledge",,,,,17482798,,,,"English","J.

However, given parental choices are made within the context of the parent–child relationship, this study investigates how perceived child characteristics influence parents’ motives for allowing their children to consume screen media. One hundred and fifty-one parents of children between 6 months and 6 years of age were surveyed regarding their beliefs and motives for using screen media for their child as well as their perceptions of their child’s temperaments as energetic or detached. Results revealed a child’s energetic temperament predicted parental media use motives beyond that of parental media beliefs in ways consistent with expected relational management goals. These results extend the uses and gratifications perspective by supporting the idea that media choices made within a relational context are best understood by considering both members within the relational dynamic. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Parental media choice;

The results indicated that 11–14-year-old girls with higher levels of parasocial interaction were more inclined to endorse idealistic romantic beliefs after watching High School Musical. In addition, the effect of watching a romantic movie decreased with increasing age. The present study provides further insight into the causal order of the relationship between romantic media use and romantic beliefs and warrants attention to girls’ consumption of unrealistic romantic media contents. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","age;

Although representations of females and minority children in animated cartoons have improved over the years, stereotypical and racially biased portrayals of females and racial minority groups remain. Using an intersectionality theoretical lens, a textual analysis was conducted to examine the representation of the two current leading, minority female characters in children’s animated cartoons: Doc McStuffins and Dora the Explorer. Character portrayals, stereotypes, challenges to traditional stereotypes, and the intersecting role of race, gender, and class on the representations of the characters are explored in this analysis. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cartoons; children; class; Doc McStuffins; Dora the Explorer; gender; Intersectionality; race; representations; stereotypes",,,,,,,,,"Aubrey, J.S., Harrison, K., The gender-role content of children's favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions (2004) Media Psychology, 6, pp. 111-146; Baker, K., Raney, A.A., Equally super?

We discuss scholars’ corrective efforts, particularly in recent years, in moving beyond these narrow foci to investigate how young people situated across social classes, racial and ethnic boundaries, and forms of disability engage with new media. In particular, we examine how scholars have conceptualized similarities and differences among children and families in relation to interconnected systems of oppression and privilege. We discuss how their work has challenged deficit-based approaches to cultural and social difference to understand how diverse families and young people actively negotiate media and technologies in everyday life. We argue that an intersectional, asset-oriented approach to studying the lived experiences of youth and families opens exciting new avenues for research that prioritizes the rights of children and adolescents in the digital age. © 2016 Taylor and Francis.","Children; Class; Disability; Diversity; Immigration; Intersectionality; Media; Technology",,,,,,,,,"Akom, A.A., Cammarota, J., Ginwright, S., Youthtopias: Toward a new paradigm of critical youth studies (2008) Youth Media Reporter, 4, pp. 109-129; Alper, M., (2014) Digital Youth with Disabilities, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Barcus, F.E., Parental influence on children’s television viewing (1969) Television Quarterly, 4, pp. 63-73; Bernheimer, L.P., Gallimore, R., Weisner, T.S., Ecocultural theory as a context for the individual family service plan (1990) Journal of Early Intervention, 14, pp. 219-233; Bernstein, N., (2002) The Lost Children of Wilder: The Epic Struggle to Change Foster Care, , New York, NY: Vintage Books; Chalfen, R., Rich, M., Studying research capabilities of youth media: Analyzing children’s audiovisual expressions about health (2011) International Perspectives on Youth Media, pp. 103-118. , In J.

To increase the likelihood that new media support children’s development, research in the coming decade must stay current with advancing technology. With the advent of various forms of interactive digital media, key research questions involve social and physical interactivity. How should adults appropriately support children’s use of different kinds of media to promote children’s creativity, learning, and development? How does co-viewing (social interaction) overlap with and differ from contingency built into the medium itself? When a device interacts, does that change the kind of support required of a co-viewing adult, or eliminate the need for such support? How does the introduction of new technology impact the lives of families? Issues related to video chat, touchscreen and motion capture technology, artificial intelligence, and electronic books and games are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Active mediation; Co-viewing; Contingency; Digital technology; ebooks; Interactivity; Media; Television; Touchscreen; Video chat",,,,,,,,,"(1999) Media Education.

The claim is based on three observations: dominance of discourse-based research, the variability and context-dependency of meaning, and lack of attention to the embodied and situated. From these critical reflections, and by drawing on some concrete examples, the article argues that giving attention to the non-discursive aspects of children’s media practices is essential in bringing new insights to the field and suggests such attention should be brought into future research agendas.

These services shape the communication practices and media consumption habits of families, influencing how parents guide children’s media use, and how parents and children connect with one another. In this paper, I explain how the growing prevalence of mobile media and cloud computing has different implications at each stage of young people’s development. I then argue that the advent of pervasive, ubiquitous media has engendered the practice of “transcendent parenting” which goes beyond traditional, physical concepts of parenting, to incorporate virtual and online parenting and how these all intersect. In this emergent form of parenting, parents must transcend every media consumption environment that the child may enter, their children’s offline and online social interaction milieu and “timeless time” as experienced in the apparent ceaselessness of parenting duties. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Ceaseless parenting; Cloud computing; Digital educational technologies; Family communication; Mobile media; Parental mediation; Timeless time; Transcendent parenting",,,,,,,,,"(2014) Tabla!, , http://www.asiaone.com, Bangalore parents develop app to track homework, May 2), Retrieved from; Castells, M., (1996) The Rise of the Network Society, 1. , Cambridge, MA: Blackwell Publishing; Clark, L., (2013) The Parent App: Understanding Families in the Digital Age, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Gentzler, A.L., Oberhauser, A.M., Westerman, D., Nadorff, D.K., College students’ use of electronic communication with parents: Links to loneliness, attachment, and relationship quality (2011) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 14, pp. 71-74; Harrison, K., Media and the Family (2015) Journal of Children and Media, 9 (1), pp. 1-4; Jiow, H.J., Lim, S.S., The evolution of video game affordances and implications for parental mediation (2012) Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, 32, pp. 455-462; Khrais, R., Phone home: Tech draws parents, college kids closer (2012) NPR, , http://www.npr.org, September 25, Retrieved from; Kwon, M., Kim, D.J., Cho, H., Yang, S., The smartphone addiction scale: Development and validation of a short version for adolescents (2013) Plos One, 8; Lim, S.S., Asymmetries in Asian families’ domestication of mobile communication (2016) Mobile Communication and the Family-Asian Experiences in Technology Domestication, pp. 1-9. , S.

The paper draws on ethnography’s and ethnomethodology’s experience of using video recordings as primary data and their commitment to prioritising the participants’ perspective(s). First, it is argued that one of the main challenges for social researchers is to obtain data that make it possible to broaden our understanding of media practices that are both translocal and multimodal. Second, it is argued that new media interfaces make it particularly important to understand visual data and describe children’s media practices. Third, this means that researchers will face new challenges and dilemmas with respect to choosing images, and deciding when and how to use them and what one wants to illustrate. Even more important, this will most likely increase the importance of research ethics when the quality of research as a professional practice is discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Child perspective; Ethnography; Ethnomethodology; Fieldwork; Media practices; Participatory research; Research ethics; Video recordings; Visual data",,,,,,,,,"Burn, A., Richards, C., (2014) Children’s games in the new media age: Childlore, media and the playground, , Farnham: Ashgate; Clark, A., Moss, P., Kjørholt, A.T., (2005) Beyond listening: Children’s perspectives on early childhood services, , Bristol: Policy Press; Gee, J.P., (2010) New digital media and learning as an emerging area and ""worked examples"" as one way forward, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Hammersley, M., Atkinson, P., (1983) Ethnography: Principles in practice, , London: Tavistock; Heath, C., Hindmarsh, J., Luff, P., (2010) Video in qualitative research: Analysing social interaction in everyday life, , Los Angeles, CA: Sage; Knoblauch, H., Baer, A., Laurier, E., Petschke, S., Schnettler, B., Visual analysis.

Argument draws upon two recent qualitative studies with children between six and eleven years of age. These studies, although separate, shared certain phenomenology orientated conceptual underpinnings and arrived at relatable findings. Notably that participating children tended to address media in a platform agnostic manner and offered little sense that they saw the media platform itself as being of overriding significance to their holistic media engagement. Ultimately, if children’s lived media engagement is dialogic and holistic, then focusing on only one discreet media utterance (like television for example) can be said to become deeply problematic to those within children’s media practice, education and research. © 2016 The Author(s).

Detailed measures of time spent with media can offer insights into what ""screen time"" consists of for young people today. The commentary offers examples from data collected for the non-profit organization Common Sense through a nationally representative, probability-based survey of 2,658 8- to 18-year-olds in the US in 2015. The data challenge several commonly held assumptions, and confirm others.

In this paper, three members of Association for Research in Cultures of Young People’s (ARCYP’s) Executive examine current and future tensions within children’s media studies by drawing on lessons from ARCYP’s opening decade. Both ARCYP and JOCAM emerged during a time of productive intersections between the fields of children’s studies and media studies. Here, we draw on ARCYP’s history as part of an examination of ongoing lacunae that have arisen as sites of common concern have emerged. These tensions-having to do with notions of textuality and authority, consumption and children’s agency and citizenship and power-point to lacunae in the field of children’s media studies. ARCYP’s history of development is thus taken up as a lens to see the past and imagine the future priorities of our research field. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","ARCYP; Children; Children’s media studies; Culture; Media; Text; Young people; Youth",,,,,,,,,"Appadurai, A., (2013) The future as cultural fact: Essays on the global condition, , London: Verso Books; Batada, A., Borzekowski, D., Snap!

I argue in this essay that children inhabit what Ulrich Beck termed a “risk society”, and that they experience societal risks as embodied beings. Foregrounding children’s embodiment reorients us to the realities of the connections between the vulnerability of human embodiment and the precarious nature of social institutions.

The first three practices deal with measurement— the use of attribute variables as surrogates, the use of behavioral self report data, and assuming the validity of measures. The remaining three practices deal with data analysis—assuming that scales are better than individual items, assumptions about testing relationships, and assumptions about testing group differences. These critical analyses demonstrate that each of these practices is based on faulty assumptions.

I conclude with an endorsement of research on-but not necessarily advocacy for- children’s rights in the digital age in a way that encompasses the insights both of effects research and of qualitative and participatory research with children. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Child; Digital age; Effects; Evidence-based policy; Internet; Media; Politics of research; Rights; Risk; UN convention on the rights of the child",,,,,,,,,"Barker, M., Petley, J., (2001) Ill effects: The media/violence debate, , 2nd ed, New York, NY: Routledge; Berlin, I., (1958) Two concepts of liberty: An inaugural lecture delivered before the University of Oxford on 31 October 1958, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Blackburn, R., Reclaiming human rights (2011) New Left Review, 69, pp. 126-138; Freeman, M., Veerman, P., (1992) The ideologies of children’s rights, , Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers; Hanson, K., Killed by charity’ - Towards interdisciplinary children’s rights studies (2014) Childhood, 21, pp. 441-446; Kolucki, B., Lemish, D., (2011) Communication with children: Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, , New York, NY: UNICEF; Lemish, D., (2015) Children and media: A global perspective, , Chichester: Wiley Blackwell; Livingstone, S., Do the media harm children?

Socialization theory generally describes how children internalize the rules and norms from their parents, teachers, siblings, media, and others. Socialization is, however, a bidirectional process in which children socialize their parents as well. This ""child-effect"" is a perspective that has been largely ignored in the social science literature in general, and in media research, in particular. Given recent changes in the media landscape (such as the introduction of smartphones and tablets), we argue that this needs to be investigated now more than ever. In this paper, we aim (1) to give a brief theoretical overview of the ""child-effect hypothesis"" and (2) to discuss its challenges and opportunities for future research of the relationship between parents and children in media and communication research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Bidirectionality; Child-effect; Children; Media research; Parents; Socialization",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, A., Television and family interaction (1990) Television and the American family, pp. 211-255. , J.

Research on how media use influences child health and development has increased exponentially in pediatric journals between the early 1990s and the present. Communication and psychology scholars have begun to publish their media effects work in medical journals. Health researchers, who previously synthesized existing science on media effects into policy statements and recommendations, now conduct original research. In this article, we review this transformation by documenting publication patterns in journals from different disciplines and discussing possible explanations for the shift.

From these lessons, researchers should consider focusing their work on parenting strategies that are responsive to individual differences among children, easily accessible during media use, and rigorously tested for effectiveness.

Along these grounds, what marks this current media moment as different than earlier ones, especially for young people, is that increasing numbers of them are, in very public ways, enacting the post-modern presumptions that social constructionists have long since asked educators who work with them to consider. To the extent that these processes of redefinition are occurring in mediated spheres and that educators are, for reasons of disciplinary and professional constraint among other factors, unable to fully engage and learn from the mediated spheres of their students, researchers of youth and media have a particular opportunity with respect to informing educational thought and policy in this regard. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescence; Education; Internet; Media; Online; Researchers; Schools; Teachers; Youth",,,,,,,,,"Apple, M.W., (2009) Global Crises, Social Justice and Education, , New York, NY: Routledge; Boyd, D., (2014) It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens, , New Haven, CT: Yale University Press; Eriksen, T.H., Stacking and continuity: On temporal regimes in popular culture (2007) 24/7: Time and Temporality in the Network Society, pp. 141-157. , In R.

Such rich evidence has begun to be used to inform policy-makers, (local) governments, parents, educators, awareness-raisers and even children themselves. However, other relevant stakeholders such as the industry seem to be taking less advantage of this rich knowledge base. Without industry collaboration, the work of media scholars presents a missed opportunity to ensure that children are better protected and empowered and that their rights are taken into consideration in the development of new digital products and services. Merely informing the industry is, however, not enough. Scholars must ensure that their knowledge translates into practical guidelines and concrete solutions to guarantee children`s better and safer digital experiences. This can only be achieved by keeping on building new knowledge, but also by exploring new avenues for cooperation and co-creation of childcentred solutions with partners such as the industry, but also with children themselves. Last, it remains to be seen whether the benefits outweigh the challenges and the costs involved in collaboration. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Academia; Children; Collaboration; Digital industry; Knowledge-sharing",,,,,,,,,"(2015) BBC News, , http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31502898, February 17, Retrieved from; Damasio, M.J., Cordeiro, P., Stakeholders and academia: Different modes of interaction (2014) Building Bridges: Pathways to a Greater Societal Significance for Audience Research, pp. 75-86. , In G.

PBS KIDS, in collaboration with UCLA CRESST, developed a prototype learning analytics platform (LAP) to analyze back-end data from children’s interactions with PBS KIDS transmedia content, and provide custom reports to parents that enable them to better identify and support their child’s individual learning needs. Evidence suggests that the PBS KIDS prototype LAP demonstrates potential for assessment and prediction of mathematics performance, including on the TEMA-3 standardized assessment for early mathematics. Similarly, early research findings suggest that the reporting applications developed to provide LAP information are viewed favorably by parents and promote interest in learning more about, monitoring, and engaging with their kids around learning.

As a federal Ready to Learn grantee, Hispanic Information & Telecommunications Network (HITN) designed and distributed transmedia learning resources to promote school readiness, but first had to understand and address five critical lessons: (1) the ethnic, economic, social, and educational diversity among Hispanics; (2) the central role of extended families and the impact of this on designing content; (3) the importance of personal relationships in engaging families; (4) variable digital access and its impact on development and distribution; and (5) the great need for physical learning resources. By addressing these, HITN found viable ways to use transmedia content and help engage parents in supporting their children’s school readiness and entering kindergarten on a level playing field with their peers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Digital divide; Early childhood; Educational media; Family engagement; Hispanic; Low income; Media; Parents; School readiness; Transmedia",,,,,,,,,"Casey, A.E., (2014) The 2014 Kids Count Data Book: State Trends in Child Well-Being, , Foundation, Baltimore, MD: Author; Fisch, S.M., Transmedia in the service of education: Lessons from the US Department of Education’s Ready to Learn program (2016) Journal of Children and Media, 10, pp. 223-226; Fuller, B., Lizárraga, J.R., Gray, J.H., (2015) Digital Media and Latino Families: New Channels for Learning, Parenting, and Local Organizing, , New York, NY: Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop; Jennings, N.A., Wartella, E., Digital technology and families (2013) The Routledge Handbook of Family Communication, pp. 448-462. , In A.

On the frontier of this landscape are intelligent agents: digital companions that can socially interact with and educate children. We discuss how research on parasocial relationships with media characters can influence the design of intelligent “characters” for children. We discuss the components of parasocial relationships— including attachment, character personification, and social realism— and how these may play a role in developing intelligent characters as effective educational tools. We also examine the development and dissolution of parasocial relationships, and how these factors can inform intelligent character design.

Past research shows that parent-child conversations about media content can alter the extent and effects of exposure to media content. This study, therefore, explored the predictors of negative active mediation of pornography—parent-child conversations that are critical of pornography—as well as the relationship between negative active mediation delivered during adolescence and emerging adults’ pornography use, attitudes about pornography, and self-esteem of those whose sexual partner regularly views pornography. Results revealed that the inverse relationship between negative active mediation and emerging adults’ pornography use was mediated by attitudes about pornography and that active mediation protected the self-esteem of those whose sexual partner regularly views pornography. These findings suggest that active mediation of pornography may be one way to reduce negative indirect effects of pornography exposure and prevent future pornography use. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Active mediation; Attitudes; Children; Media; Parental mediation; Pornography",,,,,,,,,"Allen, M., Emmers, T., Gebhardt, L., Giery, M.A., Exposure to pornography and acceptance of rape myths (1995) Journal of Communication, 45, pp. 5-26; Arpan, L., Rhodes, N., Roskos-Ewoldsen, D.R., Accessibility, persuasion, and behavior (2007) Communication and Social Cognition: Theories and Methods, , D.

Screen media access, bedroom television, lack of physical activity, and snacking on energy-dense foods have long been implicated in child overweight. This research used data from the first three waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children to investigate, prospectively, the associations between parental practices in early to middle childhood and children’s behaviors and weight in late childhood. A path model was used to investigate whether consistent parenting predicted setting of boundaries for access to and use of media, and was indirectly associated with children’s lifestyle behaviors that increase the likelihood of healthy weight maintenance. The findings demonstrated that children’s lifestyles pertinent to weight maintenance and media use cluster together and involve both old and newer screen media, but are also predicted by parenting practices and the family environment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Children; Lifestyle behaviors; Obesity; Parenting practices; Screen media; Television",,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: LP0991650","Research conducted by Leonie Rutherford, School of Communication and Creative Arts, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia; Judith E.

Parents also reported their beliefs concerning media effects. We found that mediation strategies differ from acknowledged media usage conceptions in that parents play a more active role than previously assumed. Restrictive mediation comprises rules and restrictions, but also parents’ educative explanations that media do not reflect reality. Patronizing mediation includes shared media consumption, but also parents commenting on media contents. Pointing out and emphasizing socio-emotional features in the media (e.g., empathy) characterize active-emotional co-use (AEC). Regression analyses revealed that parental fear of negative media effects predicted both AEC and restrictive mediation. Children and parents’ congruent perceptions of family interactions predicted AEC and patronizing VG mediation. Overall, positive ratings of family interactions were associated with children using media less frequently. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Children; Family interaction; Parental mediation; Television; Video games",,,,,,,,,"Austin, E.W., Bolls, P., Fujioka, Y., Engelbertson, J., How and why parents take on the tube (1999) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 43, pp. 175-192; Bell, R.Q., A reinterpretation of the direction of effects in studies of socialisation (1968) Psychological Review, 75, pp. 81-95; Brumariu, L.E., Kerns, K.A., Parent-child attachment and internalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence: A review of empirical findings and future directions (2010) Development and Psychopathology, 22, pp. 177-203; Buckley, K.E., Anderson, C.A., A theoretical model of the effects and consequences of playing video games (2006) Playing video games-Motives, responses, and consequences, pp. 363-378. , P.

Results indicate few associations with demographic variables. Fathers report greater ownership of baby videos/DVDs, and parents with more videos/DVDs report more satisfaction with these products. Parent attitudes toward early childhood education are related to owning more videos/DVDS, while promotionfocused orientation (i.e., propensity to pursue possible rewards when outcomes are uncertain) predicts satisfaction with baby videos/DVDs. Furthermore, results indicate that parents’ belief in the educational value of media for young children is a strong predictor of both ownership and satisfaction with these products. In light of the controversy surrounding baby videos/DVDs and growing number and variety of screen media for infants and toddlers, implications of these findings for policy and further research are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Attitudes toward media; Consumer attitudes; Infant/toddler; Media ownership; Parent; Promotion focus",,,,,,,,,"Media use by children younger than 2 years (2011) Pediatrics, 128 (5), pp. 1040-1045; Anderson, D.R., Pempek, T.A., Television and very young children (2005) American Behavioral Scientist, 48, pp. 505-522; Barr, R., Danziger, C., Hilliard, M., Olina, C., Ruskis, J., Amount, content and context of infant media exposure: A parental questionnaire and diary analysis (2010) International Early Years Education, 18, pp. 107-122; Barr, R., Muentener, P., Garcia, A., Fujimoto, M., Chávez, V., The effect of repetition on imitation from television during infancy (2007) Developmental Psycholobiology, 49, pp. 196-207; Bruer, J.T., The brain and child development: Time for some critical thinking (1998) Public Health Reports, 113, pp. 388-397; Camacho, C.J., Higgins, E.T., Luger, L., Moral value transfer from regulatory fit: What feels right is right and what feels wrong is wrong (2003) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, pp. 498-510; Carver, C.S., White, T.L., Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: The bis/bas scales (1994) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, pp. 319-333; Courage, M.L., Murphy, A.N., Goulding, S., Setliff, A.E., When the television is on: The impact of infant-directed video on 6- and 18-month-olds’ attention during toy play and on parent–infant interaction (2010) Infant Behavior and Development, 33, pp. 176-188; Deloache, J.S., Chiong, C., Babies and baby media (2009) American Behavioral Scientist, 52, pp. 1115-1135; Deloache, J.S., Chiong, C., Sherman, K., Islam, N., Vanderborght, M., Troseth, G.L., O’Doherty, K., Do babies learn from baby media?

One way of enhancing the benefits and reducing the harm of television is through parental mediation. However, existing measures of mediation are in need of an updated evaluation. The present study sought to fill this gap by investigating the validity of the most significant measure of television mediation. A survey was conducted with 701 parents of children between the ages of 6 and 12. Parents responded to closed-ended scales of mediation and genre-specific scenarios for television, as well as assessments of children’s aggression, prosocial behavior, academic achievement, and multiple intelligences. Television mediation scenarios revealed that there are significant weaknesses in the ability of Valkenburg’s television mediation scale to accurately capture parents’ mediation behaviors across television genres. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Academic achievement; Aggression; Children; Parental mediation; Parent–child interactions; Prosocial behavior; Television",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Bryant, J., Wilder, A., Santomero, A., Williams, M., Crawley, A.M., Researching Blue’s Clues: Viewing behavior and impact (2000) Media Psychology, 2, pp. 179-194; Anderson, D.R., Collins, P.A., (1988) The Impact of children’s Education: Television’s Influence on Cognitive Development, , http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED295271, (Working Paper No. 2) United States Department of Education.

Findings indicate that preschoolers represent complicated and nuanced ""consumers in training"" beyond predictions based on their ""perceptual stage of development."" Specifically, our data revealed interesting ways in which marketing and consumer culture can foster a number of pro-social consumer outcomes (e.g., charity, gift-giving, financial literacy). We also noted an emerging understanding by preschoolers of the social meanings of goods for identity construction and product evaluation. Finally, through a presentation of an idiographic case, we show how consumer socialization cannot be attributed to one factor such as media but is based on multiple and concurrent factors-parents, siblings, peers, and home environment-that act to moderate, mediate, and provide meaning for marketing messages. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Consumer behavior; Consumer socialization; Ethnography; Parental influence; Preschool children; Pro-social consumption; Qualitative method; Social identity of consumption",,,,,,,"This project was funded by a Research Award from the Mass Communication and Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.",,"Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory (1989) Annals of child development.

A convenience sample of college students was asked to describe an online self-presentation they regretted. Among the 40% of participants who shared a specific self-presentation, the most commonly regretted content included comments or images about partying, personal feelings/beliefs, or negative comments about others. The most frequently cited motivations for producing self-presentations later regretted was the desire to be like others and to see what would happen. Most respondents ultimately regretted their self-presentation because they did not feel it represented who they really were, did not appreciate the impact it would have, or realize who would encounter it. Nevertheless, the majority reported that the regret experience had been valuable, and that they changed in some meaningful way as a result. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescents; College students; Emerging adults; Informal learning; Internet; Online; Regret; Self expression; Self presentation; Youth",,,,,,,,,"Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Kingsbury, M., Schneider, B., Friendship: An old concept with a new meaning?

We organized ten focus groups in secondary schools to study the online activities of this group and their motivations for being active online. Uses and gratifications theorizing was used to acquire an understanding of the teenagers’ perspectives on the needs that may be met by these activities. The results revealed that most time was spent on somewhat passively consuming online content, although many were also busy communicating, which implied a more active form of engagement. A small group reported a high level of activity. The findings confirmed that everyday creativity is quite common in teenagers. They also suggested that this group’s social needs and requirement to express and enjoy themselves were gratified.

However, we know little about what factors predict parents’ co-use across the multiple types of media technology families own. Using a US nationally representative sample of 2,326 parents of children aged 8 and under, this study examines factors associated with parent–child couse across six types of media: books, TV, computers, video games, tablets, and smartphones. Results indicate that parents are more likely to co-use traditional media such as books and television, whereas they are least likely to co-use video games. Results also suggest that media co-use may be a function of parental availability and parents’ time spent with media, as well as parent demographics such as parents’ age, gender, ethnicity, and level of education, and child demographics such as child age and gender. Results have implications for creating more targeted parental interventions to encourage media co-use. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Children; Co-use; Media; Parents; Technology",,,,,,,,,"Policy statement on children, adolescents, and the media (2013) Pediatrics, 132, pp. 957-961; (1999) Media Education.

A common complaint is that many programs continue to depict oppressively narrow versions of normative femininity and masculinity which may contribute to the reproduction of real-life gender-related inequalities. There is, however, far more critique than there is focus on alternative models. This article responds by offering a textual analysis of the American cartoon series Adventure Time as an (unlikely) exemplar of a commercially successful children’s television program which depicts gender in a radically subversive and arguably liberatory manner. By identifying and unpacking the way Adventure Time moves beyond the simplistic inversion of existing gender stereotypes, my aim is to provide a concrete example of some of the ways gender can be portrayed more progressively and equitably in children’s film and television entertainment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Adventure time; Childhood studies; Feminism; Gender theory; Media effects; Media studies; Queer theory; Television; Textual analysis; Transnormativity",,,,,,,,,"Common Sense Media, , https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/adventure-time, (n.d.); Anders, C.J., (2012) Pendleton Ward Explains How he’s Keeping Adventure Time Weird.

Prior to the liberalisation of broadcasting in Finland, children’s television was produced to solid pedagogic standards that stemmed from the powerful Nordic ideal of “good childhood.” Analysis on changes in the structure of Yleisradio’s children’s output demonstrates that competition from commercial channels following the liberalisation of broadcasting in the 1990s forced Yleisradio to depart to an extent from its traditional paternalist-pedagogic paradigm in children’s programming and adopt elements commonly associated with commercial children’s television, manifested with a significant increase in the use of populist forms of programming and imported content. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.","Children’s programmes; Children’s television; Finland; Liberalisation; Public service broadcasting; Yleisradio",,,,,,,,,"Aslama, M., Hellman, H., Lehtinen, P., Sauri, T., Niukkuuden aikakaudesta kanavapaljouteen: Television ohjelmisto ja monipuolisuus 1960–2004 [From the age of scarcity to channel abundance: Television output and diversity 1960–2004] (2007) Television Viisi vuosikymmenta¨: Suomalainen Televisio Ja Sen Ohjelmat 1950-Luvulta Digiaikaan [Five Decades of Television: Finnish Television and Its Programmes from the 1950S to the Digital Era], pp. 58-77. , J.

Egocentrism was measured as Imaginary Audience ideation and Personal Fable ideation, two distinct concepts of adolescent egocentrism. We also examined whether age moderates the aforementioned relationship. A total of 381 participants completed the survey instrument. The sample consisted of adolescents from two high schools and college students in the Netherlands. Results indicated a positive relationship between Imaginary Audience ideation and Facebook self-disclosure. Also, more narcissistic adolescents disclosed more on Facebook than less narcissistic adolescents. However, this effect became weaker when controlling for Imaginary Audience ideation. Finally, Imaginary Audience was related to Facebook self-disclosure for all age groups except the 19-22 age group. Thus, adolescent egocentrism is a somewhat stronger a predictor of online self-disclosure than narcissism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescents; Development; Facebook; Imaginary audience; Narcissism; Personal fable; Self-disclosure",,,,,,,,,"Adams, G.R., Jones, R., Imaginary audience behavior: A validation study (1981) Journal of Early Adolescence, 1, pp. 1-10; Alberts, A., Elkind, D., Ginsberg, S., The Personal Fable and risk-taking in early adolescence (2007) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36, pp. 71-76; Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.)

We look at majority youth, excluding ethnic minorities. Since reasons for discrimination were not asked for, we suspect they may be diverse. Our central question is whether the feeling of being discriminated against has a bearing on children’s experiences with respect to online risks and on their parents’ response in the form of online mediation strategies. We hypothesize that perceived discrimination will lead to more exposure to online risks, but not necessarily to more harm. We expect that parents of children who are perceived as discriminated against will be more worried about their children and, will restrict their digital media use. Generally speaking, these hypotheses were confirmed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Country classification; EU kids online; Online risks; Parental mediation; Perceived discrimination",,,,,,,,,"Abrahamson, J., Teaching coping strategies: A client education approach to aural rehabilitation (1991) Journal of the Academy of Rehabilitative Audiology, 24, pp. 43-53; Atkin, D.J., Greenberg, B.S., Baldwin, T.F., The home ecology of children’s television viewing: Parental mediation and the new video environment (2006) Journal of Communication, 41, pp. 40-52; Darling, N., Steinberg, L., Parenting style as context: An integrative model (1993) Psychological Bulletin, 113, pp. 487-496; Dewan, S., Riggins, F.J., The digital divide: Current and future research directions (2004) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 6, pp. 298-337; Didden, R., Scholte, R.H.J., Korzilius, H., De Moor, J.M.H., Vermeulen, A., O’Reilly, M., Lancioni, G.E., Cyberbullying among students with intellectual and developmental disability in special education settings (2009) Developmental Neurorehabilitation, 12, pp. 146-151; de Waal, M., Soms op de kaasmanier, soms op onze manier [Sometimes the Dutch way, sometimes our way] (2003) De mediarevolutie.10 jaar www in Nederland, pp. 146-167. , H.

Here, I draw on several years of ethnographic research conducted in the UK and the USA to distinguish among three different types of facilitators: guides who privilege processes over outputs; collaborators who position themselves within an egalitarian team; and mentors, who draw on specialist knowledge to encourage young people to make “high quality” films. I assess the impact of these different modes on the central claims made for youth media as a means of developing skills, critical media literac(ies), and encouraging youth “voice.” Although youth media organizations struggling with sustainability often conflate these practices, these approaches lend themselves to achieving diverse aims and thus differences could be better delineated by facilitators and by funders in order to realize the ambitions proposed by youth media projects. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Critical literacy; Facilitation; Learning; Media literacy; Production; Voice; Youth media",,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/J006572/1",,,"Bazalgette, C., (2000) Moving Images in the Classroom: A Secondary teachers’ Guide to Using Film & Television, , London: British Film Institute; Belfiore, E., Defensive instrumentalism and the legacy of New Labour’s cultural policies (2012) Cultural Trends, 21, pp. 103-111; Blum-Ross, A., Voice, empowerment and youth-produced films about “gangs” Learning, Media and Technology, , Special Issue “Voice and Representation in youth media production in educational settings: transnational dialogues”; Blum-Ross, A., Authentic representations?

In contrast to films from the 1980s and 1990s, in which sons struggle to live up to their fathers’ expectations, these films demand a change in paternal attitudes, requiring fathers to adapt to their sons’ needs instead. The article argues that the films offer a didactic message to fathers as well as sons, which suggests that in postfeminist fatherhood older parenting models are no longer viable, and a new culture of fatherhood is needed, which may offer a way of challenging hegemonic masculinity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Animated films; Disney; Fatherhood; Masculinity; Motherhood; Postfeminism; Sony",,,,,,,,,"Armengol-Carrera, J., Where are fathers in American literature?

We conclude with a call for various research traditions to come together and enrich youth media research as a means of building a solid foundation for youth policy and social change. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Comparative research; Eurocentrism; International communication research; Polycentric methodology; Youth media",,,,,,"128877","This work was supported by Finnish Academy [grant number 128877].",,"Ackerly, B., True, J., (2010) Doing Feminist Research in Political and Social Science, , New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan; Blumler, J., McLeod, J., Rosengren, K., (1992) Comparatively Speaking: Communication and Culture across Space and Time, , London: Sage; Carpentier, N., (2011) Media and Participation: A Site of Ideological-Democratic Struggle, , Bristol: Intellect; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide through Qualitative Analysis, , London: Sage; Clifford, J., (1997) Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Dahlgren, P., (2003) Internet and the Democratization of Civic Culture, , http://ccce.com.washington.edu/news/assets/conference:papers/dahlgren.pdf, Retrieved December 27, 2013, from; Dahlgren, P., Doing citizenship: The cultural origins of civic agency in the public sphere (2006) European Journal of Cultural Studies, 9, pp. 267-286; Dahlgren, P., Young citizens and political participation: Online media and civic cultures (2011) Taiwan Journal of Democracy, 7, pp. 11-25; Denzin, N.K., (1979) The Research Act: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods, , New York, NY: McGraw Hill; Dimaggio, P., Hargittai, E., (2001) From the “Digital Divide” to “Digital Inequality”: Studying Internet Use as Penetration Increases, , https://www.princeton.edu/,artspol/workpap15.html, Working Paper #15, Summer, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University.

This leads to a limited knowledge of the broader diasporic population and makes it difficult to ascertain how media use is related to age and generation (both in terms of migration and in terms of digital media access), independent of belonging to a specific ethnic-cultural group. To explore these issues, 30 adolescents from 16 national backgrounds and their parents were interviewed. Despite their diverse cultural backgrounds, clear generational differences were found, the younger participants demonstrating shared media uses and preferences (e.g. focusing more on entertainment and less on the country of origin). Although ethnic roots are important, age and generation are primary factors for understanding media uses and preferences among diasporic audiences, which cautions against an exclusive focus on ethnic-cultural identity in research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescents; Age; Diaspora; Generation; Internet use; Second-generation; TV viewing",,,,,,,,,"Adriaens, F., (2012) On Mute: Diaspora Youth.

Yet, research demonstrates suboptimal online information literacy among youth today, suggesting potential shortcomings in young people’s information consumption behaviors. To assess this, this study investigates several predictors of young people’s success in online information evaluation, including their awareness of credibility problems associated with digital information, their use of specific information evaluation practices, and their accuracy in credibility assessment. Results from a study of 2,747 11–18-year-old Internet users indicate both expected and surprising influences of young people’s cognitive development, decision-making style, demographic background, and digital information literacy training on their information evaluation awareness, skills, and practices. Theoretical implications and those for redesigning online information literacy interventions are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Children and media; Credibility; Information evaluation; Information literacy; Internet; Survey",,,,,,"John D. and Catherine T.

Although infants spent little time actively watching TV, the majority of mothers in all groups reported the TV typically turned on in the room at least half the time during all types of play. Mothers reported middle-SES infants engaged more frequently in individual and dyadic toy play, but lower-SES infants were more often exposed to background TV/video during play. Because play is important to infant development and background TV can disrupt it, these findings raise concerns, particularly for infants residing in lower-SES households. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Background television; Mother-child interaction; Play infants; SES",,,,,,,,,"Aber, J.L., Jones, S., Cohen, J., The impact of poverty on the mental health and development of very young children (2000) Handbook of Infant Mental Health, pp. 113-128. , In C.

We analyze whether main antagonists engage with both prosocial and aggressive behaviors (including physical, indirect, and verbal aggression). Moreover, we explore demographics of main antagonists and context of each aggressive and prosocial act initiated by a main antagonist. Results from a content analysis showed that main antagonists in Studio Ghibli-animated films tend to participate in both prosocial and aggressive behaviors, while those in Walt Disney-animated films tend to commit only aggressive behaviors to harm others. This study concludes that the difference in the portrayal of main antagonists between Walt Disney-animated films and Studio Ghibli-animated films may reflect the difference between analytic and holistic thinking style. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Analytic; Animated films; Causal attribution; Holistic; Main antagonist",,,,,,,,,"Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory (1989) Annals of Child Development: Six Theories of Child Development, 6, pp. 1-60. , In R.

This study examines parents’ monitoring, internet mediation, and modeling behaviors as predictors of adolescents’ computer/internet use among 629 US adolescents and their parents. Parents’ time spent with computers was positively associated with teens’ computer time, and parents’ engagement in seven internet activities (e.g., IM/chat) also predicted teens’ engagement in those activities. Greater general parental monitoring of adolescents predicted less teen engagement in IM/chat, social networking site use, video streaming, and multiplayer online games, while parental tracking of internet use predicted more teen IM/chat. Older teens spent more time with computers and in various internet activities and reported lower rates of general parental monitoring and parental internet mediation. Findings suggest that parents act as models for their children’s internet use. Additionally, general parental practices not specific to media may affect youths’ media behaviors as well. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescent; Computer; Internet; Mediation; Modeling; Parental monitoring; Social cognitive theory",,,,,,,,,"Children, adolescents, and the media: Council on Communications and Media (2013) Pediatrics, 132, pp. 958-961; Aoyama, I., Barnard-Brak, L., Talbert, T.L., Cyberbullying among high school students: Cluster analysis of sex and age differences and the level of parental monitoring (2011) International Journal of Cyber Behavior Psychology and Learning (IJCBPL), 1, pp. 25-35; (2012) Education and Prevention: Nonproductive Sedentary Behavior, , http://www.health.gov.au/internet/publications/publishing.nsf/Content/gug-carer-toc,gug-carer-sedentary, February, Australian Government; Bandura, A., (1986) Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Barradas, D.T., Fulton, J.E., Blanck, H.M., Huhman, M., Parental influences on youth television viewing (2007) Journal of Pediatrics, 151, pp. 369-373; Bleakley, A., Jordan, A.B., Hennessy, M., The relationship between parents’ and children’s television viewing (2013) Pediatrics, 132, pp. 364-371; Bleakley, A., Vaala, S.E., Jordan, A.B., Romer, D., The Annenberg Media Environment Survey: Media access and use in US homes with children and adolescents (2014) Media and the Well-Being of Children and Adolescents, , A.

In this study, 372 Dutch children (9–13 years old) participated. Children in the experimental condition were exposed to prosocial news showing children organizing a fundraising action for UNICEF. In the control condition, children were exposed to news about UNICEF in which no prosocial behavior was included. Afterwards, children were given the opportunity to donate to UNICEF, which served as an index of prosocial behavior. Prosocial intentions were captured using paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Regression analysis demonstrated that, while controlling for important confounders, children exposed to prosocial news were significantly more willing to help with setting up a project for UNICEF and donated more to UNICEF compared to children who did not watch prosocial news. These findings highlight that prosocial television can function as a tool for positive social change among children. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Positive media psychology; Prosocial behavior; Television news",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., The influence of attitudes on behavior (2005) The handbook of attitudes, pp. 173-221. , D.

We conducted an experiment (N = 134) where seven- to eleven-year-old children watched a cartoon with an embedded advertising block. Half of the children saw a commercial for a specific brand of chocolate candies. After watching, we measured actual brand choice. We found that children watching the target commercial chose the advertised brand significantly more often compared to children not watching the target commercial. The primary contribution of the present study is the examination of how temporal delay influences this effect. We manipulated the time that elapsed between exposure to the commercial and brand choice. Analysis indicated that the behavioral effect on brand choice was only evident immediately after exposure and did not persist over time. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Behavior; Brand; Children; Decay; Food choice; Television commercials",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.E., Crespo, C.J., Bartlett, S.J., Cheskin, L.J., Pratt, M., Relationship of physical activity and television watching with body weight and level of fatness among children (1998) JAMA, 179, pp. 938-942; Appel, M., Richter, T., Persuasive effects of fictional narratives increase over time (2007) Media Psychology, 10, pp. 113-134; Arendt, F., News stereotypes, time, and fading priming effects (2013) Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 90, pp. 347-362; Asendorpf, J., Conner, M., De Fruyt, F., De Houwer, J., Denissen, J., Fiedler, K., Wicherts, J., Recommendations for increasing replicability in psychology (2013) European Journal of Personality, 27, pp. 108-119; Auty, S., Lewis, C., Exploring children's choice: The reminder effect of product placement (2004) Psychology & Marketing, 21, pp. 699-716; Borzekowski, D.L.G., Robinson, T.N., THE 30-s effect: An experiment revealing the impact of television commercials on food preferences of preschoolers (2001) Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 101, pp. 42-46; Boush, D.M., Mediating advertising effects (2001) Television and the American family, pp. 397-412. , J.

An analysis of issue frames is presented too. Findings show that the TV coverage is more episodic in nature—triggered by individual cyberbullying incidents— than the print coverage. Episodic frames attribute causal responsibility to individuals rather than institutions or broader social forces. Results show the overall debate on cyberbullying is narrow, focused on incidents that resulted in suicides, and subsequent blaming of individuals involved. Such framing can have implications for audience’s support of punitive policies, inability to comprehend complexity of the issue and moral panic around children’s use of technology. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Causal responsibility; Content analysis; Cyberbullying; Episodic frames; Framing; Issue frames; Thematic frames; Treatment responsibility",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Top 25 U.S. newspaper for March 2013, , http://www.auditedmedia.com/news/blog/top-25-us-newspapers-for-march-2013.aspx, Alliance for Audited Media; (2012) Cyberbullying, a question of punishment., , http://aspanational.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/cyber-bullying-a-question-of-punishment/, ASPA National Weblog.

In particular, social networking sites (SNSs) may facilitate sexual harassment. This study used focus groups to examine sexual harassment on SNSs from adolescents’ (aged 12–18 years) point of view: what do they perceive as severe cases and who do they think should play a role in addressing them. The qualitative data suggested that sexual harassment was appraised as more severe when it concerned personally targeted gender harassment, situations with restricted escape possibilities, the use of insulting words, the non-consensual use of pictures for sex-related purposes, or frequent adult-initiated sexual attention. Adolescents think that educating potential victims and harassers is important.

Additionally, it explored the moderating role of children’s sex in these relationships. To address these aims, parents of 865 Dutch children (3–7 years) completed a survey measuring ADHD-related behaviors and kept four-day television diaries. We found that ADHD-related behaviors were not associated with overall viewing nor with violent/scary content viewing. These relationships, however, were moderated by sex. Further analyses of these moderations revealed a positive trend between ADHD-related behaviors and overall and violent/scary content viewing for boys only. ADHD-related behaviors were not related to educational content viewing. Furthermore, ADHD-related behaviors were related to more arousal when viewing television, regardless of content, and less attention to overall and educational television. We did not find sex differences in arousal and attention responses. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ADHD; ADHD-related behaviors; Arousal; Attention; Content; Television",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for no television contact before age 2, growth mixture modeling identified 3 trajectory classes, comprising heavy-start contact (8%, mean contact time at age 0 = 331.44 min/day), characterized by remarkably long television contact time in infancy and maintenance of longer contact, while mild contact (51%, 147.57 min/day) and moderate contact (41%, 236.64 min/day) had relatively shorter contact in infancy and moderate declines in later years. The findings suggest that both infant temperamental difficulties and family characteristics predicted trajectory classification of television contact time. Scores for attention problems and conduct problems at age 5 did not significantly differ among trajectory groups, nor did regression coefficients. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Contact time; Externalizing problems; Infancy; Longitudinal study; Preschool period; Television",,,,,,,"This study is a part of the Better Broadcasting for Children Project, sponsored by the NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute.",,"Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Integrative guide for the 1991 CBCL/4-18, YSR and TRF profiles, , Burlington, VT: Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont; Media use by children younger than 2 years (2011) Pediatrics, 128, pp. 1040-1045; Barr, R., Danziger, C., Hilliard, M.E., Andolina, C., Ruskis, J., Amount, content and context of infant media exposure: A parental questionnaire and diary analysis (2010) International Journal of Early Years Education, 18, pp. 107-122; Calkins, S.D., Keane, S.P., Developmental origins of early antisocial behavior (2009) Development and Psychopathology, 21, pp. 1095-1109; Campbell, S.B., (2002) Behavior problems in preschool children: Clinical and developmental issues, , (2nd ed.).

Speculation exists that these suboptimal effects are due to psychological reactance following a restrictive mediation interaction leading the adolescent toward defiant behavior. A survey of undergraduate students (N = 483) was conducted to investigate the process of psychological reactance as a mediating factor in the relationship between restrictive parental mediation and three unintended effects: negative attitude toward parents, positive attitude toward restricted content, and increased viewing of restricted content with friends. Results revealed a direct effect of restrictive mediation on attitude toward parent, but not attitude toward restricted content or viewing restricted content with friends. Moreover, the reactance process fully mediated restrictive mediation’s effect on attitude toward restricted content and viewing restricted content with friends, and partially mediated the effect on attitude toward parents. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Parental mediation; Parenting; Parent–child conflict; Psychological reactance; Restrictive mediation",,,,,,,,,"An, S., Lee, D., An integrated model of parental mediation: The effect of family communication on children's perception of television reality and negative viewing effects (2010) Asian Journal of Communication, 20, pp. 389-403; Bizer, G.Y., Hart, J., Jekogian, A.M., Belief in a just world and social dominance orientation: Evidence for a meditational pathway predicting negative attitudes and discrimination against individuals with mental illness (2012) Personality and Individual Differences, 52, pp. 661-701; Brehm, J.W., (1966) A theory of psychological reactance, , New York, NY: Academic Press; Brehm, J.W., Brehm, S.S., (1981) Psychological reactance: A theory of freedom and control, , San Diego, CA: Academic Press; Brewin, C.R., Andrews, B., Gotlib, I.H., Psychopathology and early experience: A reappraisal of retrospective reports (1993) Psychological Bulletin, 113, pp. 82-98; Buijzen, M., The effectiveness of parental communication in modifying the relation between food advertising and children's consumption behaviour (2009) British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 27, pp. 105-121; Buijzen, M., Valkenburg, P.M., Parental mediation of undesired advertising effects (2005) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 49, pp. 153-165; Buijzen, M., van der Walma Molen, J.H., Sondij, P., Parental mediation of children's emotional responses to a violent news event (2007) Communication Research, 34, pp. 212-230; Cho, H., Sands, L., Gain- and loss-frame sun safety messages and psychological reactance of adolescents (2011) Communication Research Reports, 28, pp. 308-317; Christakis, D., Ebel, B., Rivara, F., Zimmerman, F., Television, video, and computer game usage in children under 11 years of age (2004) The Journal of Pediatrics, 145, pp. 652-656; Darling, C.A., Hicks, M.W., Parental influence on adolescent sexuality: Implications for parents as educators (1982) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 11, pp. 231-245; Davison, K.K., Francis, L.A., Birch, L.L., Links between parents' and girls' television viewing behaviors: A longitudinal examination (2005) The Journal of Pediatrics, 147, pp. 436-442; Dillard, J.P., Kinney, T.A., Cruz, M.G., Influence, appraisals, and emotions in close relationships (1996) Communication Monographs, 63, pp. 105-130; Dillard, J.P., Shen, L., On the nature of reactance and its role in persuasive health communication (2005) Communication Monographs, 72, pp. 144-168; Grandpre, J., Alvaro, E.M., Burgoon, M., Miller, C.H., Hall, J.R., Adolescent reactance and anti-smoking campaigns: A theoretical approach (2003) Health Communication, 15, pp. 349-366; Guo, W., Nathanson, A.I., The effects of parental mediation of sexual content on the sexual knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of adolescents in the US (2011) Journal of Children & Media, 5, pp. 358-378; Harrison, K., Cantor, J., Tales from the screen: Enduring fright reactions to scary media (1999) Media Psychology, 1, pp. 97-116; Hayes, A.F., (2013) Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Hoffman, M.L., Moral development (1970) Carmichael's manual of child psychology, 2, pp. 261-360. , P.

A prospective cohort study with a 2-year follow-up of 1,147 (baseline non-smoking) adolescents between 13 (youngest cohort) and 16 years old (oldest cohort) was conducted in Flanders (Belgium) in order to examine these objectives. The data indicated that music television viewers have an increased probability of being a smoker 2 years later, even after entering the control variables in the model. This relationship appeared to be moderated by school year. The odds of being a smoker doubled for the adolescents in the youngest cohort who watched music television at least several times a week. For those in the youngest cohort who watched music television almost every day, the odds of being a smoker were almost four times higher than the odds of those watching rarely or not. For the adolescents in the oldest cohort no relationship between music television viewing and smoking was found. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescents; Age; Gender; Music television; Smoking; Television",,,,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek

It is hypothesized that background, adult-directed TV reduces the quantity and quality of parent language addressed to their young children. To test this hypothesis, the current study compared parent language directed at 12-, 24-, and 36-month-old toddlers (N ¼ 49) in the presence and absence of background TV. In the presence of background TV, the number of words and utterances spoken per minute by the parent decreased as did the number of new words per minute. However, mean length of utterances did not differ. Because parent input is an important factor for language acquisition, development may be negatively affected by background TV exposure. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Background television; Infant; Language development; Parent speech; Parent-child interaction; Toddler",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: BCS-1226550, NSF DLS 0921173","This research was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation to Daniel R.

This study articulates a model of parasocial relationship development among children and, in the process, establishes new measures of children’s parasocial interactions and parasocial relationships. Parents of children (≤ 8 years old) completed an online questionnaire about their child’s favorite media character. The measure of parental perceptions of children’s parasocial relationships was composed of three dimensions: character personification, social realism, and attachment. The measure was then utilized as the endogenous variable in a model predicting parental perceptions of children’s parasocial relationships. The model revealed that engagement with toy replicas of media characters, repeated media exposure, parent encouragement, and parasocial interactions were significantly related to parental perceptions of young children’s parasocial relationships. The possible influence of parasocial relationships on children’s potential to learn from media characters is discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Parasocial interaction; Parasocial relationship; Parent engagement; Parent survey; Structural equation modeling; Toy play",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1252113, 0126014","This work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers 0126014 and 1252113.

Results indicated that boys were significantly more likely to have a female favorite character at a younger age than at their current age, but girls were no more likely to have a male favorite character at a younger age than at their current age. As children aged and transitioned to new favorite media characters, boys’ favorite characters became more masculine and girls’ favorite characters became more feminine. Child maturation, the influence of other media characters, and habituation to the character were the most commonly cited reasons for children experiencing parasocial breakup. Findings are discussed in terms of the similarities between face-to-face friendship dissolution and parasocial breakup among children and the importance of character gender to children’s PSR, especially as children mature. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Gender; Parasocial breakup; Parasocial relationship; Survey; Young children",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1252113, 0126014","This work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation [grant number 0126014], [grant number 1252113].

The model focuses on children’s allocation of their limited cognitive resources, with attention to the resources used for comprehending the narrative versus the educational content within the show. The model predicts that, when narrative processing demands are reduced, narrative comprehension will be improved. Reduced narrative demands are also expected to support educational content comprehension as greater cognitive resources are available to process the content. This prediction was tested with 172 American children (102 females, M = 4.2 years). Narrative processing demands were operationalized via story schema. Results from a correlational analysis supported predictions. Advanced story schema was associated with improved narrative and educational content comprehension.

This research investigates whether television viewing is related to adolescents’ views about the consequences of drinking and whether psychological trait reactance moderates this cultivation effect. Results from a survey of 445 American teenagers show that cumulative exposure to television is linked to reduced beliefs about alcohol’s negative consequences and greater intentions to drink. These effects were greater for adolescents low on trait reactance. This research adds to the general psychological research on trait reactance as a moderator of media influences and makes a substantive contribution toward furthering our understanding of the media and public health concerns that surround risky adolescent behaviors. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Adolescence; Cultivation; Persuasion; Psychological reactance; Television",,,,,,,"This research was funded by grant R01-AA016969 from the United States National Institutes of Health to the first author.",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications; Albarracín, D., Cohen, J.B., Kumkale, G.T., When communications collide with recipients’ actions: Effects of post-message behavior on intentions to follow the message recommendation (2003) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 29, pp. 834-845; Allen, D.N., Spenkel, D.G., Vitale, P.A., Reactance theory and alcohol consumption laws: Further confirmation among collegiate alcohol consumers (1994) Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 55, pp. 34-40; Barradas, D.T., Fulton, J.E., Blanck, H.M., Huhman, M., Parental influences on youth television viewing (2007) Journal of Pediatrics, 151, pp. 369-373; Boehnke, K., Münich, T., Hoffmann, D., Development through media use?
